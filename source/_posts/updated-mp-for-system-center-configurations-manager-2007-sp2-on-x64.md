Microsoft has released an updated <acronym title="Management Pack">MP</acronym> for <acronym title="System Center Configurations Manager">SCCM </acronym>SP2 (v6.0.6000.2, released on 10/28/2009) for OpsMgr R2.

The update basically contains support for x64 that was missing in the previous release.
> The Configuration Manager 2007 SP2 Management Pack adds support for monitoring Configuration Manager 2007 SP2 in a 64-bit environment with Operations Manager 2007 R2 or Operations Manager 2007 SP1 with hotfix (KB971541) installed. This enables the Configuration Manager 2007 SP2 Management Pack to work with either the 32-bit or the 64-bit Operations Manager 2007 agent. **Except for the 64-bit support, the other features and guidance for Configuration Manager 2007 Management Packs remain intact**.

Emphasis is mine.
