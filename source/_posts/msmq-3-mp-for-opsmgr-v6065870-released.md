# Release History

* 6/3/2008 - Initial Release, version 6.0.6278.23\. Refer to the MP guide for further details.*   4/24/2009 - Undated release, version 6.0.6587.0\. Refer to the MP guide for further details.  

The MP Guide does not really say much about what's updated and I don't know how much more than the reporting they have fixed. I can just state the fact that support for clustered MSMQ 3 instances is still missing.
