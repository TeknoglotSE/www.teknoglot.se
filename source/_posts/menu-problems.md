The menus are looking a bit off as you may have noticed.

I guess it's an issue with WordPress 3.4 and [Superfish](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/ "Superfish") and are trying to figure out where it goes haywire.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

# Update

I switched the theme to at least get the navigation working while I try to figure out what the problem with the regular theme is.
