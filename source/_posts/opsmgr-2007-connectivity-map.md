[![SCOM Connectivity Map](http://teknoglotse.nfshost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SCOM_Connectivity_Map-300x279.png "SCOM Connectivity Map")](http://teknoglotse.nfshost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SCOM_Connectivity_Map.png)I've had this little visio drawing lying around on my desktop for a while now and I thought that it might be a nice thing to share.

It is nothing ground breaking at allÂ and all the information is available at the [Operations Manager 2007 R2 Supported Configurations](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb309428.aspx "Operations Manager 2007 R2 Supported Configurations") page on Technet, but I find the visual map easier to read and I use it personally to quickly look up all port openings for the most common components in Operations Manager.

It is missing a few components like ACS, AEM and XPlat, but I usually just look them up when needed.

Have fun!
