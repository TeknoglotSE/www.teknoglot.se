# BRK1039 - Windows Server Software Defined

`The fastest route to the benefits of hyper-converged infrastructure`

WinSrv 2016, "Most cloud ready OS", "Security" etc

Talking about how WS2016 makes it possible to define Network, Compute and Storage in software, as virtual machines/Applicances.

## WSSD

Microsoft defines reference architecture, Solution vendors make and certify hardware packages, customers use and get rekommendations from Microsoft and vendors.

### Benefits

- Pre-validated
    - Partner validated against reference architecture
- Time to value
    - Up and running quickly
- Optimized OOB
    - Less guesswork
    - Tuned for the hardware solution
- Hardware Choice
    - Select best match from vendors

### Converged Storage

VMs on SMB3 on S2D on SOFS Cluster

### Hyper-Converged

VM on S2D SOFS Cluster
Simpler management and deployment, all contained in each "box". 

### Cloud-Inspored Infrastructure

Functionality|Hyper-Converged Standard|Hyper-Converged Premium|Converged SDS
---|---|---|---
Security|Y|Y|Y
SDN|N|Y|N
Networking|Y|Y|Y
Compute|Y|Y|N
Storage|Y|Y|Y
Server|Y|Y|Y

### Key Use Cases

- Low-cost high-performance storage
    - FileServer, Hyper-V, Databases, Media streaming, High-throughput data ingestion
- Infrastructure for VM
    - Enterprise Apps, VDI, Hosting, IT Infrastructure aka Fabric
- SQL Server Databases
- Backup/Archive

>Some of the examples given in this section looks less like Hyper-Converged and more like a tad smarter file clusters.

### WSSD reference architecture

- Design Overview
    - Hardware Requirements
    - Expansion
- Server Hardware
- Server and Cluster Configuration
- Net Configuration
- Storage Configuration
- Security Configuration

Then, from requested or required workload, decide what offering (Hyper-Converged Infrastructure or Converged) and design to use.

### Quality-Assurance - End to End

- Comp and System Certification
    - IHV & Server Vendor
    - Win2016 Logo + SDDC Qualifiers
- Solution Validation
    - Solution Vendor
        - reference architecture
        - Stress
        - Quality-Assurance

### PCS - Private Cloud Simulator

Cool, but can I run it myself?

It is a public tool, but it might need a partner login to access, speaker was unsure. Speaker also suggested that, while it is possible for us to use the tool, it is not developed as a load-tester for any other than the WSSD solution developers. 

*It would probably be better for us to stick to tools like [VMFleet](https://github.com/Microsoft/diskspd/tree/master/Frameworks/VMFleet).*

### Automated Deployment

This is offered by WSSD Partner, although Microsoft has a DSC-kit prepared.

### Customer "demo"

- Moving from Server Cluster + iSCSI
- Mostly File Servers and SQL
- Maxed out at 15000 IOPS
- Latency spikes of 50-100ms (ouch)

Went to:
- S2D
    - Hyper-Converged Infrastructure
    - Hyper-V + Storage on the same node
- Simple
- Fault tolerant
- Good performance
- Lower costs

Opted for DataOn S2d-3216

Tested with VMFleet
- 2225479 IOPS
- 6,6MB/s throughput
- 0.99 Microsoft latency

These tested numbers have held true when in production as well.

## Personal Reflections

Again, very little real world talk. It's all happy-sunshine-candyland.

I have customers that are testing HCI, and from them I know that there is some things you really have to think about to succeed. It would be nice to hear what parts of the WSSD-rollout was super easy and a little on what popped up as "gotchas".

All these IOPS gains; are they from the S2D clusters or mainly from going from SAS/SATA to SSD? Not sure what kind of disks they had before and what performance the could have gotten from simply upgrading their storage.
