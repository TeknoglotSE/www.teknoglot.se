Now would you look at that.

Since my old site, Tranquillity.se, got messy and unfocused I have now started a new one. That's right, you're looking at it.

Instead of blogging about mostly anything like I did before I have decided to split it into Three sites. This one for the Technical stuff, some other site I haven't set up yet, and a personal blogg for the... personal blogging... stuff.

When time gives, I will import the old tech-related posts from Tranquillity.se into this site but for now. Nothing yet so far.

Have a nice day!
