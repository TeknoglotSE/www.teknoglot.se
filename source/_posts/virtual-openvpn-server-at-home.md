I was going to write a post on how to install and configure your own virtual SSL-VPN server as I had in mind to make one myself as a means to surf safely while on hotspots and to access my System Center lab at home.

I'm not gonna do that. Instead I just want to point to this free, already pre-configured, [OpenVPN Virtual Appliance](http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/va/320963 "Free OpenVPN Appliance"). Just follow its instructions and it will work quite nicely.

Have fun.
