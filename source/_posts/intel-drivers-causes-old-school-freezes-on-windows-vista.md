I recently got a nice new Lenovo ThinkPad T61 laptop at work to replace the old T42 I had earlier. Totally nice with 2,2GHz dual-core, Windows Vista and stuff.

Now, there seems to be a problem with some drivers since I get the back-to-the-90s kinda lockups. You know were pretty much everything remotely interactive freeze. No BSOD, no crasches, no reboot. Just a plain freeze and all you can do is to press and hold the powerbutton until the computer powers off.

Apparently, these problems are caused by some bug or something in the Intel Turbo Memory Driver and the Intel Matrix Storage Manager in combination with some power-save feature in Windows Vista called "Windows Hybrid Hard Disk Power Savings Mode". (Christ! Whatever happened to abrevations? I think i want those back. "ITMD and IMSM with WHDDPSM causes hickups"... no... wait.)

Aaaanyway.
