I recently added another 500MB of RAM to my computer... and there was much rejoice.

However, after a few days it started to behave erraticly when pressing the Fn+F12 combo (on a ThinkPad thatÂ means "Hibernate"). It simply refused to hibernate with the very intuitive error message "Insufficent System Resources Exist to Complete the API".

Anyway. [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft.com") has a fix for it, and you don't have to call them to get it anymore either. Just follow the link below.
