Here a link to the [System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2 Documentation](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=4561 "System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2 Documentation") for those of you out there who keeps asking of its whereabouts and then tell me to not tell you to [google for it](http://www.google.se/search?q=opsmgr+2007+r2+documentation "opsmgr 2007 r2 documentation").

So now I can direct you to my site, tell you to click on "OpsMgr 2007" to the left and browse through my posts instead of wasting precious time on googling and pretend being more helpful.
To the rest of the world, sorry for wasting your time!

Happy now, eh?
