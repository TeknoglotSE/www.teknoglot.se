Oh my God, I actually moved my blog for real. I think I've been putting this upp for nearly half a year now and even though I actually went and bought a "real" domain-name for it.

But now it'd done. The server is now self-hosted and self-maintained. Now, that obviously gives me a bit more to do, but on the other hand. I can fix any problems myself and not have to create tickets and hope someone responding to them knows what they're talking about.

The design is mostly borrowed, for now, but it works and I hope I did all the HTACCESS rules on the old server correct so that they forward all the old links to the same post on the new one.

So, welcome!
