I, as well as others, have noticed some slow performance from my blog lately and I just wanted to let you know that the root cause have been identified as a bug in on of the crypto libs on the server.

I haven't found a working solution yet but are trying to keep an eye on the site regularly to be able to bounce the problematic services when they start to act up.

Hopefully there will be a fix available soon.

Sorry for any inconvenience in the meantime.
