# Who's stegenfeldt?
A Solution Architech at [Atea Sverige AB](https://www.atea.se/) based in Sweden with a focus on IT-monitoring, Observability and closely related automations.

For the past decade or two, the focus has been mainly on the Microsoft System Center side of things, including related products like SquaredUp DS, and some tutoring as a Microsoft Certified Trainer. But the open source world has always been calling in the background.  
For the past years (as of writing this in early 2025), there's been a shift back towards more freely available and open sourced products, of which Zabbix and Grafana are favourites.  
Expect more content in that area from now on.
