# {{ title }}

> My Fieldnotes are quick, unrefined notations and reflections from the field.  
> Content may be obvious and unnecessary to some, useful to others. The main purpose is for them to be used as a searchable notebook.  
> These Notes are not to be seen as a manual, a how-to or a set of instructions, but rather a collection of thoughts, reflections and experiences from my field-work.
