# {{ title }}

> Field Notes are quick, unrefined notes from the field.  
> Content may be obvious and unnecessary to some, useful to others. The main purpose is as a searchable notebook.  
> These Notes are not to be seen as a manual, a how-to or a set of instructions, but rather a collection of thoughts and experiences from field-work.
