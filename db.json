I am lazy like that.\n\nGet the gist of it [here][1].\n\n# The \"Why\"\n\nOk, so. I am a consultant, as you may know. And as a consultant, people pay me to do stuff and expect me to be efficient and deliver with high quality.\nPart of that entails writing documentation containing how I do stuff, where I do it and often why I do it.\nThis documentation is expected to be detailed enough to make sure my customers will be able to follow the steps and produce a copy of my work. Most of the time\nthese document are a big part of the disaster recovery processes and might have to be executed by the on-call staff with no previous knowledge of the product.\n\nThis means screenshots. Lots of screenshots.\nAnd while templates are nice and help me out a lot, the screenshots have to be from the actual installation and not some copy-pasta from a previous assignment.\nTo help me out, I use the excellent free program [Greenshot][2] to quickly generate screenshots into a WIP-folder (or directly into Word if that is appropriate) and that makes it possible to\ngrab snapshots of the process without having to pause all the time to `PrtScn-Alt+Tab-Ctrl+V-Crop-Ctrl+C-Alt+Tab-Ctrl+C`. I simply press `PrtScn` and go on with the installation.\n\nBeing a bit pedantic, doesn't help me out here though as I find myself selecting and resizing all the images in the Word document I have produced.

currently decommissioning an entire Management Group with a thousand (-ish) agents. Long story short, we got a new Management Group, migrated all the agents, added a couple of hundreds more, deployed a bunch of gateways and now we are shutting down the old one.</p>\n<p>Now, uninstalling the old Management Group from all the agents is a breeze using SCCM and handling the few 20-ish servers that are left is not a biggie either. Shutting down ACS, however, is a different matter.</p>","more":"<p>Although you do configure your forwarders using Operations Manager, removing the management group you were running ACS in does not mean the agents will shut down and disable the AdtAgent service or stop trying to forward audit events to your collector. Now, selecting 10 agents at the time and running the “Disable Audit Collection” task–in case you did not know, there’s a limitation on how many agents you can run a task on in the Operations Console–is not my idea of a jolly good day and since Powershell is a bucket of joy in comparison; here’s a script for you all!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://teknoglotse.nfshost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DisableACSForwarders.zip\">DisableACSForwarders</a></p>\n<p>It is zipped to avoid security alerts, but as with any script found on the internet I implore to to read the code before actually running it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, you can use it in a couple of ways.</p>\n<p>To run it interactively, just go to the directory where you unpacked it and run it. You will be requested to enter the FQDN of you Root Management Server and a wildcard search for ACS Forwarders.<br>For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bat\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\">C:\\..\\<span class=\"title\">Scripts</span>&gt; .\\<span class=\"title\">DisableACSForwarders.ps1</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"title\">Root</span> <span class=\"title\">Management</span> <span class=\"title\">Server</span>: <span class=\"title\">rms.teknoglot.local</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"title\">ACS</span> <span class=\"title\">Forwarder</span> <span class=\"title\">name</span> (<span class=\"title\">wildcard</span>): *.<span class=\"title\">teknoglot.local</span></span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You can also run it with parameters (for scheduling?) like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bat\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\">C:\\..\\<span class=\"title\">Scripts</span>&gt; .\\<span class=\"title\">DisableACSForwarders.ps1</span> <span class=\"title\">rms.teknoglot.local</span> *.<span class=\"title\">teknoglot.local</span></span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>If you need to run the task with different credentials there’s a switch for that. Just add -UseCredentials to the command and you will be prompted for it.<br>Like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bat\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\">C:\\..\\<span class=\"title\">Scripts</span>&gt; .\\<span class=\"title\">DisableACSForwarders.ps1</span> -<span class=\"title\">UseCredentials</span></span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>As you might already have realized, the wildcard search does not require actual wildcards. If you only want to disable the ACS forwarder on a single machine, just enter it’s FQDN. As for what wildcards it will accept; <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa717088%28VS.85%29.aspx\" title=\"Supporting Wildcard Characters in Cmdlet Parameters\">anything supported by the powershell -like operator</a> is valid.</p>\n<p>[UPDATE!] You might get false failures when running the script on clustered machines because of a <a

Paths?","id":"171","date":"2009-10-21T07:39:17.000Z","_content":"\nWhat do you do when you cannot delete a file or folder on a windows server?\n\nCheck the file permissions! And if that doesn’t help?\n\nCheck the share permissions! Yes, if it is a shared folder. And if that doesn’t help?\n\nCheck the file ownership! Great! But then what?\n\nWell, the file could be in use, and then you would have to shut the locking process down and perhaps kick a user out. In a really bad scenario it could also be a symptom of a broken filesystem, a reserved filename (like “lpt1” or “PRN”) or even an invalid name (silly things like a space in the beginning or the end of a filename).\nAnother possible reason could actually be that the path to the file or folder is too long. You won’t actually get an error telling you that the filepath exceeds the 255 characters Windows can handle but a simple “Acces Denied”.\n\nThere are some, more or less tedious, work-arounds for the problem.

At the same time, I've been using [DynDNS](http://www.dyn.com \"Dyn DNS\") to provide name resolution to my home network/lab. Browsing around the [CloudFlare JSON API](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html \"CloudFlare Client Api\") I noticed that I can update DNS records through some fairly simple HTTP GET requests, and since the RouterOS (the operating system used by [Mikrotik's](http://www.mikrotik.com/ \"Mikrotik Website\") routerboards) has support for some pretty decent scripting I decided to let my router update CloudFlare for some custom and free dynamic DNS resolution.\n\n# Attribution\n\nMy current script is a modified version of a script developed by Konstantin Antselovich.\n\nOriginal script: [http://konstant1n.livejournal.com/9759.html](http://konstant1n.livejournal.com/9759.html \"Random Journal\")\n\nOriginal Author website: [http://konstantin.antselovich.com/](http://konstantin.antselovich.com/ \"Konstantin Antselovich\")\n\nThanks!\n\n# How you do it\n\n## What you need\n\n* RouterOS v6+ for HTTPS support\n* Cloudflare API key, aka \"Token\", found at the [account page](https://www.cloudflare.com/my-account \"CloudFlare Account Page\")\n* Cloudflare DNS Zone name\n* Cloudflare Record Id (more on that later)\n* Cloudflare subdomain name\n* Name of the external router interface\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Getting the Record Id\n\nTo get the record id of the DNS record you want to update, I used the _[rec_load_all](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html#s3.3 \"rec_load_all - Get all DNS Records\")_ function of the API. And since I'm a windows admin, I use powershell for that.\n\n```powershell\n$cfDomain = \"homelab\"\n$cfToken = \"<your API Key/Token>\"\n$cfZone = \"example.com\"\n$cfEmail = \"<your CF email address>\"\n$apiLoadAllRecordsURI = \"https://www.cloudflare.com/api_json.html?a=rec_load_all&tkn=$cfToken&email=$cfEmail&z=$cfZone\"\n$restRequest = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $apiLoadAllRecordsURI\n$restRequest.response.recs.objs | ?{$_.display_name -eq $cfDomain} | fl -Property rec_id,name,display_name,type,ttl,service_mode\n```\n\nThat should, given that you've replaced all the example variables produce something like this:\n\n```text\nrec_id : 16606003\nname : homelab.example.com\ndisplay_name : homelab\ntype : A\nttl : 1\nservice_mode : 0\n```\n\nAnd with that done, you should have everything necessary for the RouterOS script.\n\n## Building the Script\n\nI'm not going to go into the [syntax of ros scripts](http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Scripting \"RouterOS Scripting Manual\"), but I'll try to explain the different building block to some degree.\n\n### Defining our variables\n\nFirst, we'll define out variables used for the script. The global _$hostname_ variable is actually redundant as I could derive the FQDN from  _$CFDomain_ and _$CFZone_, but it's used in other scripts in my router so it's included for that purpose alone.\n\n```text\n######## Set and collect general variables #########\n:global hostname \"homelab.example.com\"\n:global resolvedIP \"\"\n:global externalIP \"\"\n:global WANInterface \"eth1-ext-internet\"\n\n######## Set CloudFlare variables #################\n:local CFemail \"<same email as in the powershell script\"\n:local CFtkn \"<your API key/token>\"\n:local CFzone \"example.com\"\n:local CFid \"16606003\"\n:local CFtype \"A\"\n:local CFttl \"1\"\n:local CFservicemode \"0\"\n:local CFDomain \"homelab\"\n:local CFDebug \"true\"\n```\n\nTake care to verify and compare the CFxx variables with the ones used in and received from the previous powershell script, but also the _$hostname_ variable.\n\n* hostname: Used in the script to lookup the currently set IP-address.\n* WANInterface: The list name of the external interface, used to find the external IP-address.\n* CFemail: Your CloudFlare Login email.\n* CFtkn: Your API Key/Token.\n* CFzone: Your DNS Zone.\n* CFid: The rec_id from the powershell script.\n* CFtype: A for IPv4 host records, AAAA for IPv6.\n* CFttl: Record time-to-live, use \"1\" for automatic.\n* CFservicemode: Use \"0\" for direct traffic or \"1\" to go through their CDN, Optimizations and Security features. I recommend \"0\" for anything but websites.\n* CFDomain: Subdomain or rather hostname for your router.\n* CFDebug: Use \"True\" to print some informational stuff to the router logs.\n\n### Resolve IP-addresses\n\nNext, we resolve two IP-addresses. First one, _$externalIP_, is the routers current external address. And the second, _$resolvedIP_, is the address currently set for our _$hostname_.\n\n```text\n######## Resolve and set IP-variables ##########\n:local currentIP [/ip address get [/ip address find interface=$WANInterface ] address];\n:set externalIP [:pick $currentIP 0 [:find $currentIP \"/\"]];\n:set resolvedIP [:resolve $hostname];\n```\n\n### Build CF API Request and log debug info\n\nNow, build the URI for the API call from our variables.\n\n```text\n######## Build CF API Url #########################\n:local CFurl \"https://www.cloudflare.com/api_json.html\\3F\"\n:set CFurl ($CFurl . \"a=rec_edit&tkn=$CFtkn&id=$CFid\");\n:set CFurl ($CFurl . \"&email=$CFemail&z=$CFzone&type=$CFtype\");\n:set CFurl ($CFurl . \"&name=$CFDomain&service_mode=$CFservicemode&ttl=$CFttl\");\n```\n\nAnd if the _$CFdebug_ variable is set to \"true\", write a little info to the router log.\n\n```text\n######## Write debug info to log #################\n:if ($CFDebug = \"true\") do={\n:log info (\"CF: hostname = $hostname\")\n:log info (\"CF: resolvedIP = $resolvedIP\")\n:log info (\"CF: currentIP = $currentIP\")\n:log info (\"CF: externalIP = $externalIP\")\n:log info (\"CF: CFurl = $CFurl&content=$externalIP\")\n};\n```\n\n### Compare and Update\n\nLast step is to compare _$externalIP_ with _$resolvedIP_. If they don't match, our external IP-address has been changed and we need to update the DNS record. To execute the HTTP GET request we use a RouterOS tool called [fetch](http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Fetch \"Mikrotik Manual: Fetch\") to which we pass the _$CFurl_ variable. The reason this will not work before RouterOS v6+ is that before that there was no support for HTTPS, and CloudFlare does not accept unencrypted traffic for their APIs.\n\nThe script block is pretty straight-forward. Compare, update, flush local DNS-cache and write to the log.\n\n```text\n######## Compare and update CF if necessary #####\n:if ($resolvedIP != $externalIP) do={\n:log info (\"CF: Updating CF, setting $CFDomain = $externalIP\")\n/tool fetch mode=https url=\"$CFurl&content=$externalIP\" keep-result=no\n/ip dns cache flush\n} else={\n:log info \"CF: No Update Needed!\"\n}\n```\n\n### Permissions/Policies\n\nThis part, I'm not entirely sure on. The script needs to do name resolution, read settings and set variables and it works for me with these policies configured:\n\n* Read\n* Write\n* Test\n* Sniff\n* Sensitive\n\nIt might be over-doing it a bit, but I have not had occasion to fiddle with them yet.\n\n### Scheduling\n\nI have this script scheduled to run once every 20 minutes. As it will only try to update the DNS records if there is a difference between them and the current external IP-address I feel fairly sure that I won't be tagged as a spammer or something by CloudFlare.\n\nThe schedule is configured with:\n\n* Start Time: startup\n* Interval: 00:20:00\n* On Event: ```/system script run <Name of your script>```\n* Policy: Read,Write, Test, Sniff, Sensitive\n\nThis schedule is also a good place for a [hairpin](http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Hairpin_NAT \"Mikrotik Wiki: Hairpin NAT\") update if it's needed.\n\n# The Copy-Paste part\n\nNow, obviously, at least make sure you proof-read the script before putting it into production. I am not a network dude, and I rarely dabble with ROS scripts. I am certain that anyone with a bit more experience could create a smarter, prettier version of this script, so **use at your own risk**.

At the same time, I've been using [DynDNS](http://www.dyn.com \"Dyn DNS\") to provide name resolution to my home network/lab. Browsing around the [CloudFlare JSON API](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html \"CloudFlare Client Api\") I noticed that I can update DNS records through some fairly simple HTTP GET requests, and since the RouterOS (the operating system used by [Mikrotik's](http://www.mikrotik.com/ \"Mikrotik Website\") routerboards) has support for some pretty decent scripting I decided to let my router update CloudFlare for some custom and free dynamic DNS resolution.\n\n# Attribution\n\nMy current script is a modified version of a script developed by Konstantin Antselovich.\n\nOriginal script: [http://konstant1n.livejournal.com/9759.html](http://konstant1n.livejournal.com/9759.html \"Random Journal\")\n\nOriginal Author website: [http://konstantin.antselovich.com/](http://konstantin.antselovich.com/ \"Konstantin Antselovich\")\n\nThanks!\n\n# How you do it\n\n## What you need\n\n* RouterOS v6+ for HTTPS support\n* Cloudflare API key, aka \"Token\", found at the [account page](https://www.cloudflare.com/my-account \"CloudFlare Account Page\")\n* Cloudflare DNS Zone name\n* Cloudflare Record Id (more on that later)\n* Cloudflare subdomain name\n* Name of the external router interface\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Getting the Record Id\n\nTo get the record id of the DNS record you want to update, I used the _[rec_load_all](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html#s3.3 \"rec_load_all - Get all DNS Records\")_ function of the API. And since I'm a windows admin, I use powershell for that.\n\n```powershell\n$cfDomain = \"homelab\"\n$cfToken = \"<your API Key/Token>\"\n$cfZone = \"example.com\"\n$cfEmail = \"<your CF email address>\"\n$apiLoadAllRecordsURI = \"https://www.cloudflare.com/api_json.html?a=rec_load_all&tkn=$cfToken&email=$cfEmail&z=$cfZone\"\n$restRequest = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $apiLoadAllRecordsURI\n$restRequest.response.recs.objs | ?{$_.display_name -eq $cfDomain} | fl -Property rec_id,name,display_name,type,ttl,service_mode\n```\n\nThat should, given that you've replaced all the example variables produce something like this:\n\n```text\nrec_id : 16606003\nname : homelab.example.com\ndisplay_name : homelab\ntype : A\nttl : 1\nservice_mode : 0\n```\n\nAnd with that done, you should have everything necessary for the RouterOS script.\n\n## Building the Script\n\nI'm not going to go into the [syntax of ros scripts](http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Scripting \"RouterOS Scripting Manual\"), but I'll try to explain the different building block to some degree.\n\n### Defining our variables\n\nFirst, we'll define out variables used for the script. The global _$hostname_ variable is actually redundant as I could derive the FQDN from  _$CFDomain_ and _$CFZone_, but it's used in other scripts in my router so it's included for that purpose alone.\n\n```text\n######## Set and collect general variables #########\n:global hostname \"homelab.example.com\"\n:global resolvedIP \"\"\n:global externalIP \"\"\n:global WANInterface \"eth1-ext-internet\"\n\n######## Set CloudFlare variables #################\n:local CFemail \"<same email as in the powershell script\"\n:local CFtkn \"<your API key/token>\"\n:local CFzone \"example.com\"\n:local CFid \"16606003\"\n:local CFtype \"A\"\n:local CFttl \"1\"\n:local CFservicemode \"0\"\n:local CFDomain \"homelab\"\n:local CFDebug \"true\"\n```\n\nTake care to verify and compare the CFxx variables with the ones used in and received from the previous powershell script, but also the _$hostname_ variable.\n\n* hostname: Used in the script to lookup the currently set IP-address.\n* WANInterface: The list name of the external interface, used to find the external IP-address.\n* CFemail: Your CloudFlare Login email.\n* CFtkn: Your API Key/Token.\n* CFzone: Your DNS Zone.\n* CFid: The rec_id from the powershell script.\n* CFtype: A for IPv4 host records, AAAA for IPv6.\n* CFttl: Record time-to-live, use \"1\" for automatic.\n* CFservicemode: Use \"0\" for direct traffic or \"1\" to go through their CDN, Optimizations and Security features.

Something that turned out to be a bit more to handle than I would have thought. So here's a little How-To.\n\n# Preparations\n\nRead the documentation provided in the Linux Integration Services download. Much of the information in this article is in there, but some parts are not. Otherwise I would not have bothered writing about it. ;)\n\nI'm not going to go through the OS installation process here, but make sure to select the \"Software Development\" packages since you will be needing it. In case you missed it, you can install them later by running these commands.\n\n```bash\n# yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"\n# yum install kernel-headers\n```\n\nI'm not actually sure that you need to run the kernel-headers install manually or if it's included in the \"Development Tools\" package.\n\nThe first gotcha i ran into was the fact that the link to the Linux Integration Services--previously known as Linux Integration Components or LinuxIC--on RedHat's information pages gave me a 404 and a redirect to a bing-search that returned the exact same 404\\. The page have simply been removed by Microsoft without any form of redirection to the new page. Anyway, a search on [http://download.microsoft.com](http://download.microsoft.com) for \"Linux Integration Components\" do return the new page, and that's where I learned about the new name.\n_Thank you for making it easy for us Microsoft!\n_Here's a direct link to the search on the current name: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/results.aspx?freetext=linux+integration+services&displaylang=en&stype=s_basic](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/results.aspx?freetext=linux+integration+services&displaylang=en&stype=s_basic)\nAnd here's a direct link to the actual download page: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=eee39325-898b-4522-9b4c-f4b5b9b64551](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=eee39325-898b-4522-9b4c-f4b5b9b64551)\n\nThis download contains an ISO file that you can mount using the Hyper-V- or VMM-console, or you can do as I did and download the ISO to the virtual machine, mount it locally, copy the files and unmount it. Like this.\n\n```bash\n# mkdir /mnt/ISO\n# mount -o loop /root/LinuxIC v21.iso /mnt/ISO\n# mkdir /opt/linux_ic_v21_rtm\n# cp /mnt/ISO/* -R /opt/linux_ic_v21_rtm/\n# umount /mnt/ISO\n```\n\nYou probably have to be root to do this by the way.\nWith that done, let's get to the installation.\n\n# Installation\n\nAs root, do the following:\n\n```bash\n# export PATH=$PATH:/sbin\n# cd /opt/linux_ic_v21_rtm/\n# make\n make install\n# reboot\n```\n\nWhy the export PATH command? Apparently, on RHES5, /sbin is not in the PATH by default and this is something that the make scripts are completely unaware of. The \"make install\" will try to run \"depmod\" which will fail since it's not in the default path. You could also add \"PATH=$PATH/sbin\" to the root users ~/.bashrc which will put it back in the PATH but only for the root user, but I don't know if that's recommended.\nAnd, yes. You DO have to reboot after the install.\n\nIf you are running RHES5 64bit you also have to install the \"adjtimex\" package. It is in the RHN repository but also on the RHES5 Installation CD in case you have no internet connection. Install it with yum like this:\n\n```ash\n# yum install adjtimex\n```\n\nAnd from the CD (mount it first) like this:\n\n```bash\n# rpm –ivh /mnt/cdrom/Server/adjtimex-1.20-2.1.x86_64.rpm\n```\n\nAnd that's basically it for the installation.\n\n# Verification\n\nHow do you know that the driver are installed?\n\nAftr the reboot, try running \"modinfo vmbus\" which should return something like this:\n\n```bash\n# modinfo vmbus\nfilename:       /lib/modules/2.6.18-194.11.1.el5/kernel/drivers/vmbus/vmbus.ko\nverion:        2.1.25\nlicnse:        GPL\nsrcversion:     3C1899C419665CB2514F2D0\ndepends:\nvermagic:       2.6.18-194.11.1.el5 SMP mod_unload gcc-4.1\nparm:           vmbus_irq:int\npar:           vmbus_loglevel:int\n```\n\nTry that with netvsc, storvsc and blkvsc too (replace the _vmbus_ part) and you should get something similar. If you don't, the installation did not succeed.\nThe documentation also tells us to check that the components are running with \"/sbin/lsmod | grep vsc\" which should return:\n\n```bash\n# /bin/lsmod | grep vsc\nblkvsc                 70184  3\nstorvsc                64264  0\nnetvsc                 73504  0\nvmbus                  88304  3 blkvsc,storvsc,netvsc\nscs_mod              196953  6 scsi_dh,sg,blkvsc,storvsc,libata,sd_mod\n```\n\nThe numbers will probably differ from installation to installation depending on blocksizes and allocation.\n\n# Configuration\n\nConfiguration is pretty straight-forward so I'll keep this short.\n\nWhen you install the drivers you will get a new network card called **seth0**, which I presume stands for Synthetic ETHernet. There's nothing magic about it regarding configuration and \"system-configuration-network\" will work just fine.\nThe drivers will also give you a couple of SCSI-devices (if you have one attached) with the regular **/dev/sd*** naming. Simply configure these using fdisk or whatever GUI you might prefer.\n\nThere is also a note in the documentation about changing the grub configuration in the \"Additional Information...\" section. Do read that section.\n\n# Additional Comments\n\nOne thing I tend to do now that disk space is dirt cheap is to copy all ISO-files I use locally instead of mounting them when needed through Hyper-V. Simply because you can bet your insert-shorter-word-for-buttocks that the day you need it again, someone has been kind enough to have done som spring-cleaning or it's locked by another machine in the cluster. If you have it locally and followed my instructions in the \"Preparation\" section, you will allready have a /mnt/ISO directory. Only thing you'll have to do is\n\n```bash\n# mount -o loop /path/to/your.iso /mnt/ISO\n```\n\nAnd there you have it. Just remember to unmount it when you're done.\n\nI also almost never use the Hyper-V remote connection interface thingy since it will give you a GUI and the mouse just won't work. If you haven't configured a network card yet though, you could connect through Hyper-V and hit _Ctrl+Alt+F1_ to get a command prompt. Unfortunatly cut/paste don't work here, but you could run _system-configuration-network_, assign an IP-address and then connect with an SSH client. I prefer PuTTY to a degree that I usually install the ported version on my Linux desktops aswell.\n\nAnd I never logon using root. People should know this, but it should be stressed anyway. Always logon as regular user and _su_ or _sudo_ when needed. I can't understand why RHES has root-login enabled by default in the SSH-server config.\n\nGood luck!","source":"_posts/install-linuxis21-rhes5.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Installing Linux Integration Services v2.1 on Red Hat ES 5\ntags:\n  - How-To\n  - Hyper-V\n  - Linux\n  - RedHat\n  - RHES5\nid: 291\ncategories:\n  - Linux\n  - RedHat ES\ndate: 2010-08-31 12:06:04\n---\n\nOk, so I got the task to install the Linux Integration Service for Hyper-V R2 on a RedHat Enterprise Server 5\\.

To generate the certificate, the _entropy_ needs to be high enough to generate random data for the certificate creation. Without the certificate, the OpsMgr agent won’t be able to open up communications with the <acronym title=\"Management Server\">MS</acronym>. So, what creates this entropy we need? Bluntly put, a selection of hardware components that are likely to produce non-predictable data. Like a keyboard, mouse and a monitor or videocard. Of course, there’s a lot more to it, but we really don’t need to know this. What _we_ need to know is that there has to be a “bit bucket” of more than 256bytes of entropy for the certificate creation process to succeed. We also need to know that more enterprise-ish servers, like rack- or blade-servers tend to be void of things like directly attached keyboards, mouses and monitors that the linux kernel needs to be able to generate entropy. And herein lies the problem. If you have a new server that is not in full service (likely since we are trying to deploy the monitoring on it) which means that there’s not much random data flowing through the hardware and there’s no keyboard or mouse or monitor connected to it there is quite the risk that the system entropy is going to be very low. Of the linux systems that I have been deploying OpsMgr agents to, about half have failed because of “Not enough entropy”. So, here’s the steps I usually takes to ensure that discovery works. I use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to connect to the soon-to-be-monitored servers. This guide also assumes that you have SU rights on the system since all of these steps (except #1) needs it.\n\n# Workaround\n\n## 1. Check you current entropy\n\n```text\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n```\n\nIs it less than, or close to, 256? It probably is. If you don’t feel like connecting a mouse and start wiggling it around—not really feasible in a data center—and see if the entropy increases, you can generate your own random data.\n\n## 2. Generate you own random data.\nBe advised that this forced entropy will not be as random as the system-created on and thus not as secure. How much more insecure it is, I don’t know, and quite frankly I prefer to have my systems monitored yet slightly less secure than not monitored at all. Anyway, you can force your own random data by running:\n\n```text\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=~/.rnd bs=1 count=1024\n```\n\nThis creates a .rnd file with 1024B of random data that the certificate creation process will use instead of the system entropy if the file exists.\n\n## 3. Uninstall and re-discover\n\nThe first failed attempt of discovery will most likely leave a non-working agent installation that we have to remove. Otherwise we will just be stuck with an “Access Denied” error. Run:\n\n```text\nrpm –e scx\n```\n\nNow, try to discover the system again.\n\n## 4. Failed again?\n\nTry generating the certificate manually by running:\n\n```text\n/opt/microsoft/scx/bin/tools/scxsslconfig -f –v\n/opt/microsoft/scx/bin/tools/scxadmin –restart\n```\n\nRetry discovery again.\n\n## 5. Still fails?\n\nUninstall the agent once more as instructed in step 3.\nStese steps have solved my problems 100% on both SUSE and RedHat and hopefully they will help you too.\n\nInterestingely enough, these problems seems to be connected to some changes in the 2.6 kernel and basically everything that uses SSL-ish certificates will be affected.

To generate the certificate, the _entropy_ needs to be high enough to generate random data for the certificate creation. Without the certificate, the OpsMgr agent won’t be able to open up communications with the <acronym title=\"Management Server\">MS</acronym>. So, what creates this entropy we need? Bluntly put, a selection of hardware components that are likely to produce non-predictable data. Like a keyboard, mouse and a monitor or videocard. Of course, there’s a lot more to it, but we really don’t need to know this. What _we_ need to know is that there has to be a “bit bucket” of more than 256bytes of entropy for the certificate creation process to succeed. We also need to know that more enterprise-ish servers, like rack- or blade-servers tend to be void of things like directly attached keyboards, mouses and monitors that the linux kernel needs to be able to generate entropy. And herein lies the problem. If you have a new server that is not in full service (likely since we are trying to deploy the monitoring on it) which means that there’s not much random data flowing through the hardware and there’s no keyboard or mouse or monitor connected to it there is quite the risk that the system entropy is going to be very low. Of the linux systems that I have been deploying OpsMgr agents to, about half have failed because of “Not enough entropy”. So, here’s the steps I usually takes to ensure that discovery works. I use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to connect to the soon-to-be-monitored servers. This guide also assumes that you have SU rights on the system since all of these steps (except #1) needs it.\n\n# Workaround\n\n## 1. Check you current entropy\n\n```text\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n```\n\nIs it less than, or close to, 256? It probably is. If you don’t feel like connecting a mouse and start wiggling it around—not really feasible in a data center—and see if the entropy increases, you can generate your own random data.\n\n## 2. Generate you own random data.\nBe advised that this forced entropy will not be as random as the system-created on and thus not as secure. How much more insecure it is, I don’t know, and quite frankly I prefer to have my systems monitored yet slightly less secure than not monitored at all. Anyway, you can force your own random data by running:\n\n```text\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=~/.rnd bs=1 count=1024\n```\n\nThis creates a .rnd file with 1024B of random data that the certificate creation process will use instead of the system entropy if the file exists.\n\n## 3. Uninstall and re-discover\n\nThe first failed attempt of discovery will most likely leave a non-working agent installation that we have to remove. Otherwise we will just be stuck with an “Access Denied” error. Run:\n\n```text\nrpm –e scx\n```\n\nNow, try to discover the system again.\n\n## 4. Failed again?\n\nTry generating the certificate manually by running:\n\n```text\n/opt/microsoft/scx/bin/tools/scxsslconfig -f –v\n/opt/microsoft/scx/bin/tools/scxadmin –restart\n```\n\nRetry discovery again.\n\n## 5. Still fails?\n\nUninstall the agent once more as instructed in step 3.\nStese steps have solved my problems 100% on both SUSE and RedHat and hopefully they will help you too.\n\nInterestingely enough, these problems seems to be connected to some changes in the 2.6 kernel and basically everything that uses SSL-ish certificates will be affected. Even though the symptoms may be a bit more subtle, like time-outs and disconnects. For “headless” servers like those I usually to administer where the random data tend to be much lower, there’s even specialised hardware whose sole purpose is to generate random data, like the [Entropy Key](http://www.entropykey.co.uk/).

With that gone and the SDK Service, or Data Access Service, thriving on all the Management Servers HA suddenly became pretty simple. All you have to do in SCOM2012 to make sure your management groups keep on kicking is to have at-least two Management Servers and your databases clustered.\n\nThis new distributed architecture does not only give easy HA, it also makes it possible to connect to the SDK-service—be it using the Operations Console or powershell to name two options—on _any_ Management Server. This, in turn, provides for a completely new level of scalability. Choked on sessions? Deploy a new Management Server!\n\nAnyway… given all this scalability and HA, would it not be nice if you could load-balance all these SDK-sessions you will be running from System Center Virtual Machine Manager, System Center Service Manager, System Center Orchestrator, regular scheduled powershell scripts and what-not?\n\nOf course it would! And you can! The simple solution is to use the built-in Network Load Balancer (NLB for short) feature in Windows Server and that's what we're going to discuss in this post.\nBefore we go, I'd like to point to a [great article](http://systemcentertech.com/2012/02/07/load-balance-scom-2012-operations-console-connections/) written by [Justin Cook](http://systemcentertech.com/) that is covering most bases but in a less for-dummies way.

The quick way to do this is using command-line (Windows Server 2008 R2 or later?).\n\n```text\ndism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetworkLoadBalancingFullServer\n```\n\nYou also need a plan and some information about your new cluster.

The one you picked in the pre-flight table.\n\nTo enable name resolution you have to add your cluster DNS-name to your DNS-zone and point it to your dedicated cluster IP-address. Make it an A-record and it should work.\n\nIf you intend to use the cluster name from outside the local network or subnet—Operation Consoles or Powershell sessions for example—you would also need to verify that the router is able to handle the multicast packages.

Click Finish\n\n# Final Verification\n\nAfter each added host it would be proper to check if it was added correctly. The easiest way is to check their statuses in the Network Load Balancing Manager.

If you are in a lab or in an environment where it is OK to shut down Management Servers you could try that as well.\n\nConsidering my note on routers in the Cluster Post-Configuration I guess it would be prudent to point out that you should try launching SDK-sessions from all networks you intend to connect from. Just to make sure that your routers are correctly configured to handle these kinds of sessions.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n# Postlude\n\nNow; as easy this may be I would personally argue that you should involve your network team _before_ starting to deploy your load-balanced clusters. A little heads-up is always a good thing—I have noticed that network people rarely like surprises—and they might actually be able to help you all the way is you ask nicely. And maybe they'll tell you right away that some configuration is required before-hand instead of giggling frantically in a corner at your feeble attempts to troubleshoot your fresh little cluster.\n\nSoooo… have fun!\n\nAnd remember; with great powers come great responsibility.\n\n*Sheesh!

All you have to do in SCOM2012 to make sure your management groups keep on kicking is to have at-least two Management Servers and your databases clustered.\n\nThis new distributed architecture does not only give easy HA, it also makes it possible to connect to the SDK-service—be it using the Operations Console or powershell to name two options—on _any_ Management Server. This, in turn, provides for a completely new level of scalability. Choked on sessions?

With that gone and the SDK Service, or Data Access Service, thriving on all the Management Servers HA suddenly became pretty simple. All you have to do in SCOM2012 to make sure your management groups keep on kicking is to have at-least two Management Servers and your databases clustered.</p>\n<p>This new distributed architecture does not only give easy HA, it also makes it possible to connect to the SDK-service—be it using the Operations Console or powershell to name two options—on <em>any</em> Management Server. This, in turn, provides for a completely new level of scalability. Choked on sessions? Deploy a new Management Server!</p>\n<p>Anyway… given all this scalability and HA, would it not be nice if you could load-balance all these SDK-sessions you will be running from System Center Virtual Machine Manager, System Center Service Manager, System Center Orchestrator, regular scheduled powershell scripts and what-not?</p>\n<p>Of course it would! And you can! The simple solution is to use the built-in Network Load Balancer (NLB for short) feature in Windows Server and that’s what we’re going to discuss in this post.<br>Before we go, I’d like to point to a <a href=\"http://systemcentertech.com/2012/02/07/load-balance-scom-2012-operations-console-connections/\">great article</a> written by <a href=\"http://systemcentertech.com/\">Justin Cook</a> that is covering most bases but in a less for-dummies way.

Each time it was the NetworkAdapterCheck.vbs script that could not create PropertyBagData. The error message copied from one of the alerts looks like this:\n\n```text\nThe process started at 14:29:26 failed to create System.PropertyBagData, no errors detected in the output. The process exited with 0\n\nCommand executed: \"C:WINNTsystem32cscript.exe\" /nologo \"NetworkAdapterCheck.vbs\" MASKEDCOMPUTERNAME 0 false true false\nWorking Directory: C:Program FilesSystem Center Operations Manager 2007Health Service StateMonitoring Host Temporary Files 2882781\n\nOne or more workflows were affected by this.\n\nWorkflow name: Microsoft.Windows.Server.2000.NetworkAdapter.NetworkAdapterConnectionHealth\nInstance name: 0\nInstance ID: {F4C478D3-38E5-8C29-3957-E3B7F486216E}\nManagement group: MASKED\n```\n\nThis error repeats almost as often as the script is scheduled to run and appears on almost every Windows 2000 server.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n# Probable Cause\n\nI am not really sure, but after a quite a bit of troubleshooting I am pretty sure it all boils down to a malformed WMI-query.

This conclusion took me a day of laborating with settings, installing packages, uninstalling packages, reinstalling packages and a whole lot of googling.</p>\n<p>What I have come down to right now is doing the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>sudo apt-get install module-assistant</strong><br>This will install the module assistant and it will also make sure that you have all the correct linux headers to install the NVidia drivers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Going back to the “Software Sources” under i check the “Unsopported updates”.</span><br>Then i execute</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">sudo apt-get autoremove</span><br><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">sudo apt-get install nvidia-177-kernel-source</span><br><strong>m-a auto-install nvidia</strong><br><strong>UPDATE!</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After fiddling around with this Laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad T61) I really just needed these three steps to fix the problem. All of them from X using the regular nv-drivers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In a terminal, run <em>sudo apt-get install module assistant</em></li>\n<li>In a terminal, run <em>sudo m-a auto-install nvidia</em></li>\n<li>Open the “Hardware Drivers” application and pick the driver you want (177 in my case) and click Activate. If it worked alright, you’ll get the green recycle icon and be asked to reboot to activate the settings.<br>Hopefully, this might help someone. It did work for me and I am now able to work with wobbly windows and all that crap. (Besides some serious 3d stuff ;) )</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway. Since I did not save the urls, I cannot give credit to those who have pointed to stuff that did help me on the way, but I’ve actually not find information anywhere yet that solve the problem totally and, well… that’s why I did decide to post in here.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave a comment if you got any more info or if you got any help from this.</p>\n"},{"title":"OpsMgr 2007 Connectivity Map","id":"505","date":"2011-05-17T09:47:18.000Z","_content":"\n[![SCOM Connectivity Map](http://teknoglotse.nfshost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SCOM_Connectivity_Map-300x279.png \"SCOM Connectivity Map\")](http://teknoglotse.nfshost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SCOM_Connectivity_Map.png)I've had this little visio drawing lying around on my desktop for a while now and I thought that it might be a nice thing to share.\n\nIt is nothing ground breaking at all and all the information is available at the [Operations Manager 2007 R2 Supported Configurations](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb309428.aspx \"Operations Manager 2007 R2 Supported Configurations\") page on Technet, but I find the visual map easier to read and I use it personally to quickly look up all port openings for the most common components in Operations Manager.\n\nIt is missing a few components like ACS, AEM and XPlat, but I usually just look them up when needed.\n\nHave fun!","source":"_posts/opsmgr-2007-connectivity-map.md","raw":"---\ntitle: OpsMgr 2007 Connectivity Map\ntags:\n  -

We are doing the same thing in this one, but making it go faster. In my lab, it's about five times faster in fact and I only have about 20 agents to play with.

Use that post if you need references to the Inputs, the OpsMgr 2012 Modules, Management Group connection and gathering your agents and management servers.\n\n### Why Is It Faster?\n\nWe are doing the same thing, on the same agents and with the same servers. And we already did some optimization by loading them all into memory and working from there. How do you make it faster? Basically, I'm cutting the over-head of the cmdlets and how they work. You may have noticed that in the \"Do Stuff\" section, we are actually calling the `Set-SCOMParentManagementServer` cmdlet twice! Once for the primary Management Server and once for the fail-over Management Servers. In effect, we connect, fire a command, wait for result, and disconnect two times for each agent. And pretty much only because the cmdlet does not offer support to set primary and fail-over management servers at the same time. Any attempt to do so will return an ambiguous parameter error.\n\nI don't like that. A brief look at the agent object class, [Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Administration.AgentManagedComputer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.enterprisemanagement.administration.agentmanagedcomputer.aspx), revealed a method called [SetManagementServers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.enterprisemanagement.administration.agentmanagedcomputer.setmanagementservers \"AgentManagedComputer.SetManagementServers Method\"). This method takes, or actually \"requires\", two parameters. One for primary and one for fail-over management servers. Yay!\n\nUsing this method saves us a bunch of over-head and a couple of round-trips to the SDK-service.\n\n### The Challenge\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot simply toss an array of management servers at the SetManagementServers method. With a bit of knowledge or keen eyes you will spot the problem right away. I didn't and was pulling my hair for a while until I realized what caused the errors. Looking closer at how the method is defined we see this:\n\n```csharp \npublic void SetManagementServers (\n ManagementServer managementServer,\n IList failoverManagementServers\n )\n ```\n\nYou see that `IList<ManagementServer>` part?\nThat's the problem. When you run `Get-SCOMManagementServer` and save the result to a powershell variable, you will get a powershell \"Enumerable\". In C#, that would be a class that implements the `IEnumerable` interface. Sad part is, it does not also implement `IList`. If you are thinking \"IList... IEnumerable... Interface... Whaaaaa...???\" right now, don't worry. You don't have to understand this to read the script later on, just think of it as different types of data.\n\nTo get around this, we create a new object based on the dotNET List type and populate it with the management servers in our $scomFailOverMS array.\n\n```powershell \n$scomMSList = New-Object 'Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Administration.ManagementServer]'\nforeach ($scomMS in $scomFailOverMS) {\n # Loop through the array and add your failover MSs to the list\n $scomMSList.Add($scomMS)\n}\n```\n> Note:We have to do that foreach loop since our $scomMSList object do not implement IEnumerable\nStill with me?\n\n### Configuring the Agent\n\nAs the method exist on that `AgentManagedComputer` class we will call it on our `$scomAgent` object, like this:\n\n```powershell \n$scomAgent.SetManagementServers($scomPrimaryMS,$scomMSList)\n```\n\nAnd we're done!\n\nI had some doubt that this would be an improvement at first since we have to create our own objects and run an extra foreach-loop, but as we only work on objects in memory and only speak to the SDK service once per agent, we cut a lot of over-head and delays from our execution. On 20-ish agents in a lab, I've measured the execution time drop to barely a fifth.\n\n### The Copy/Paste Part\n\nAnd here's the entire script with a few added comments for clarity.

This is absolutely useful when you got this specific agent that you need to configure with a specific fail-over management server.\n\nTo spice it up a little, we are going to add a little intelligence to it and enable wild-card selections while at it. The scenario we are building this script for is that now and then you want to make sure that certain agents have fail-over management servers configured. You also want to make sure that all management servers that are not the primary management server of any selected agent will be in that list of fail-over servers. This would include any new management servers as well as exclude any removed ones. In short, make sure your agent fail-over settings are up-to-date with the current environment.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### Inputs\n\nTo use this script you need to know which management server you should connect your powershell session to and which agent, or agents, you want to check and configure.\n\n```powershell \n# Input SCOM Management Server to connect to in this session\n[string]$inputScomMS = \"scomms01.domain.local\"\n# Input an existing agent you want to modify\n[string]$inputTargetAgent = \"*.domain.local\"\n```\n\n> Note: If you are using load-balanced SDK-services, or \"Data Access Services\", pointing `$inputScomMS` to that virtual host-name will work perfectly fine.\nThis example uses a wild-card for the agent selection and I guess it's the most likely scenario for this script, but a single host-name obviously works fine as well. Supported wildcard selections are [documented at TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692793.aspx). An array of computer-names or a comma-separated list, however, will not work. You could easily add that functionality but it's out of scope for this example.\n\n### Connect to Your Management Group\n\nTo run any script against an Operations Manager 2012 Management Group we need a connection to one. To connect to a management group we have to load the OperationsManager module. Lets check for a loaded module, load it if necessary and connect to the Management Server from the `$inputScomMS` setting. If loading the module fails--maybe it is not installed--we will exit the script.\n\n```powershell \n# Check if OperationsManager module is loaded\nIf (Get-Module -Name \"OperationsManager\") {\n    try {\n        # Try to load the module\n        Import-Module -Name \"OperationsManager\"\n    } catch {\n        # Did not work, exit the script\n        Write-Output \"Could not load Operations Manager module\"\n        exit\n    }\n}\n# Module is loaded, connect to Management Group/Server\nNew-SCOMManagementGroupConnection -ComputerName $inputScomMS\n```\n\nA good idea would, of course, be to first check if we already have an existing management group connection before creating a new one. But that's up to you.\n\n### Rally Your Agents (and Management Servers)\n\nSince we cannot manage manually installed agents--that would be AD-integrated or installed locally using Configuration Manager or maybe the wizard--through powershell we don't even want to try. So we'll exclude them.\n\nWe also need all the available management servers. <del>This will not handle Gateway servers as they have their own cmdlet, `Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer`, in Operations Manager 2012.</del> Strike that! There is a specific cmdlet for Gateway Servers in OpsMgr 2012, but the regular `Get-SCOMManagementServer` actually don't care whether it's a normal Management Server or a Gateway Server. The `Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer`, however, only return real Gateway Servers. That means that this script will not care if it is a Management Server or a Gateway Server, so be sure to add some kind of filtering before running it in a Management Group containing management servers.\n\n```powershell \n# Select matching remotely manageable agents\n$scomAgents = Get-SCOMAgent -DNSHostName $inputTargetAgent | Where-Object {$_.ManuallyInstalled -ne $true}\n# Get all management servers\n$scomManagementServers = Get-SCOMManagementServer\n```\n\nThe reason I like to store all matching agents in a variable is that we will save ourselves a lot of trips to the Data Access Service later on, and we also get a nice collection to run our foreach-loop on. This method is much faster than running `Get-SCOMAgent` inline as we did in \"The Basics\".\n> Note: It would probably be a good idea to check that `$scomAgents` actually contains anything; checking for `$null` with a simple `if() `would be enough.\n\n### Do Stuff\n\nWe have our connection to the management group, we have collected our agents, and we have our management servers. It's time to loop through the agents and set their Primary and Fail-over management servers.\n\n```powershell \nforeach ($scomAgent in $scomAgents) {\n    # Get the primary management server for the agent\n    $scomPrimaryMS = $scomManagementServers | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq $scomAgent.PrimaryManagementServerName}\n    # Remove the primary MS from \"all MS\" array to use it for FailOver servers\n    $scomFailOverMS = $scomManagementServers | Where-Object {$_.Name -ne $scomPrimaryMS.Name}\n    # Set Primary Management Server\n    Set-SCOMParentManagementServer -Agent $scomAgent -PrimaryServer $scomPrimaryMS\n    # Set Fail-over Management Server\n    Set-SCOMParentManagementServer -Agent $scomAgent -FailoverServer $scomFailOverMS\n}\n```\n\nThe nice thing about loading the agents and the management servers into variables is that all the information you need for this script is pre-cached in memory. You don't have to connect to the management group to find out which management server happens is the primary for each agent.

This is absolutely useful when you got this specific agent that you need to configure with a specific fail-over management server.\n\nTo spice it up a little, we are going to add a little intelligence to it and enable wild-card selections while at it. The scenario we are building this script for is that now and then you want to make sure that certain agents have fail-over management servers configured. You also want to make sure that all management servers that are not the primary management server of any selected agent will be in that list of fail-over servers. This would include any new management servers as well as exclude any removed ones. In short, make sure your agent fail-over settings are up-to-date with the current environment.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### Inputs\n\nTo use this script you need to know which management server you should connect your powershell session to and which agent, or agents, you want to check and configure.\n\n```powershell \n# Input SCOM Management Server to connect to in this session\n[string]$inputScomMS = \"scomms01.domain.local\"\n# Input an existing agent you want to modify\n[string]$inputTargetAgent = \"*.domain.local\"\n```\n\n> Note: If you are using load-balanced SDK-services, or \"Data Access Services\", pointing `$inputScomMS` to that virtual host-name will work perfectly fine.\nThis example uses a wild-card for the agent selection and I guess it's the most likely scenario for this script, but a single host-name obviously works fine as well. Supported wildcard selections are [documented at TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692793.aspx). An array of computer-names or a comma-separated list, however, will not work. You could easily add that functionality but it's out of scope for this example.\n\n### Connect to Your Management Group\n\nTo run any script against an Operations Manager 2012 Management Group we need a connection to one. To connect to a management group we have to load the OperationsManager module. Lets check for a loaded module, load it if necessary and connect to the Management Server from the `$inputScomMS` setting. If loading the module fails--maybe it is not installed--we will exit the script.\n\n```powershell \n# Check if OperationsManager module is loaded\nIf (Get-Module -Name \"OperationsManager\") {\n    try {\n        # Try to load the module\n        Import-Module -Name \"OperationsManager\"\n    } catch {\n        # Did not work, exit the script\n        Write-Output \"Could not load Operations Manager module\"\n        exit\n    }\n}\n# Module is loaded, connect to Management Group/Server\nNew-SCOMManagementGroupConnection -ComputerName $inputScomMS\n```\n\nA good idea would, of course, be to first check if we already have an existing management group connection before creating a new one. But that's up to you.\n\n### Rally Your Agents (and Management Servers)\n\nSince we cannot manage manually installed agents--that would be AD-integrated or installed locally using Configuration Manager or maybe the wizard--through powershell we don't even want to try. So we'll exclude them.\n\nWe also need all the available management servers. <del>This will not handle Gateway servers as they have their own cmdlet, `Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer`, in Operations Manager 2012.</del> Strike that! There is a specific cmdlet for Gateway Servers in OpsMgr 2012, but the regular `Get-SCOMManagementServer` actually don't care whether it's a normal Management Server or a Gateway Server. The `Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer`, however, only return real Gateway Servers. That means that this script will not care if it is a Management Server or a Gateway Server, so be sure to add some kind of filtering before running it in a Management Group containing management servers.\n\n```powershell \n# Select matching remotely manageable agents\n$scomAgents = Get-SCOMAgent -DNSHostName $inputTargetAgent | Where-Object {$_.ManuallyInstalled -ne $true}\n# Get all management servers\n$scomManagementServers = Get-SCOMManagementServer\n```\n\nThe reason I like to store all matching agents in a variable is that we will save ourselves a lot of trips to the Data Access Service later on, and we also get a nice collection to run our foreach-loop on. This method is much faster than running `Get-SCOMAgent` inline as we did in \"The Basics\".\n> Note: It would probably be a good idea to check that `$scomAgents` actually contains anything; checking for `$null` with a simple `if() `would be enough.\n\n### Do Stuff\n\nWe have our connection to the management group, we have collected our agents, and we have our management servers. It's time to loop through the agents and set their Primary and Fail-over management servers.\n\n```powershell \nforeach ($scomAgent in $scomAgents) {\n    # Get the primary management server for the agent\n    $scomPrimaryMS = $scomManagementServers | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq $scomAgent.PrimaryManagementServerName}\n    # Remove the primary MS from \"all MS\" array to use it for FailOver servers\n    $scomFailOverMS = $scomManagementServers | Where-Object {$_.Name -ne $scomPrimaryMS.Name}\n    # Set Primary Management Server\n    Set-SCOMParentManagementServer -Agent $scomAgent -PrimaryServer $scomPrimaryMS\n    # Set Fail-over Management Server\n    Set-SCOMParentManagementServer -Agent $scomAgent -FailoverServer $scomFailOverMS\n}\n```\n\nThe nice thing about loading the agents and the management servers into variables is that all the information you need for this script is pre-cached in memory. You don't have to connect to the management group to find out which management server happens is the primary for each agent. And you don't have to run `Get-SCOMManagementServer` for each agent to select which ones that will be fail-over management servers. All that information is in memory, and memory is fast.\n\n### The Copy/Paste Part\n\nAs usual, here's the entire script for you to copy.

If loading the module fails–maybe it is not installed–we will exit the script.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight powershell\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Check if OperationsManager module is loaded</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">If</span> (<span class=\"built_in\">Get-Module</span> -Name <span class=\"string\">\"OperationsManager\"</span>) &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">try</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">        <span class=\"comment\"># Try to load the module</span></div><div class=\"line\">        <span class=\"built_in\">Import-Module</span> -Name <span class=\"string\">\"OperationsManager\"</span></div><div class=\"line\">    &#125; <span class=\"keyword\">catch</span> &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">        <span class=\"comment\"># Did not work, exit the script</span></div><div class=\"line\">        <span class=\"built_in\">Write-Output</span> <span class=\"string\">\"Could not load Operations Manager module\"</span></div><div class=\"line\">        <span class=\"keyword\">exit</span></div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;</div><div class=\"line\">&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Module is loaded, connect to Management Group/Server</span></div><div class=\"line\">New-SCOMManagementGroupConnection -ComputerName <span class=\"variable\">$inputScomMS</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>A good idea would, of course, be to first check if we already have an existing management group connection before creating a new one.

There is a specific cmdlet for Gateway Servers in OpsMgr 2012, but the regular <code>Get-SCOMManagementServer</code> actually don’t care whether it’s a normal Management Server or a Gateway Server. The <code>Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer</code>, however, only return real Gateway Servers. That means that this script will not care if it is a Management Server or a Gateway Server, so be sure to add some kind of filtering before running it in a Management Group containing management servers.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight powershell\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Select matching remotely manageable agents</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$scomAgents</span> = Get-SCOMAgent -DNSHostName <span class=\"variable\">$inputTargetAgent</span> | <span class=\"built_in\">Where-Object</span> &#123;<span class=\"variable\">$_</span>.ManuallyInstalled <span class=\"nomarkup\">-ne</span> <span class=\"literal\">$true</span>&#125;</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Get all management servers</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$scomManagementServers</span> = Get-SCOMManagementServer</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The reason I like to store all matching agents in a variable is that we will save ourselves a lot of trips to the Data Access Service later on, and we also get a nice collection to run our foreach-loop on.

You probably also noticed that to get an object for a gateway server you also have to use `Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer` in OpsMgr 2012.\n\nFor some reason, there's different properties on agent objects compared to management and gateway servers. On an MS or GW, you use `-Name` to select by name, while on an agent you have to use `-DNSHostName`. Both of these parameters take wild-cards making it possible to find all the agents named \"*.domain.local\".\n\nWhile `-PrimaryServer` only takes a single object the `-Agent`, `-GatewayServer` and `-FailoverServer` can take an array or collection of objects.\n\nOne more \"gotcha\" I ran into is the fact that trying to set both` -PrimaryServer` and `-FailoverServer` in the same command will fail with an \"AmbiguousParameterSet\" error. You have to run it once for the Primary Management Server and once for your Fail-over Management Servers.\n\n### Related Snippets\n\nApart from setting your management servers you might also want to read your agent's current configuration as well.\n\n##### Get current Primary Management Server on Agent\n\n```powershell\n#Get current Primary MS on Agent\n$agent = Get-SCOMAgent -DNSHostName \"AGENT.domain.local\"\n$primaryMS = $agent.GetPrimaryManagementServer()\nwrite-host \"Current Primary ManagementServer: \"$primaryMS.Name\n```\n\n##### Get current Failover Management Server on Agent\n\n```powershell\n#Get current Failover MS on Agent\n$agent = Get-SCOMAgent -DNSHostName \"AGENT.domain.local\"\n$failoverMSs = $agent.GetFailoverManagementServers()\nwrite-host \"Got\"$failoverMSs.Count\"failover Management Servers\"\nforeach($failoverMS in $failoverMSs) {\n $failoverMS.Name\n}\n```\n\nI think that would be all for this post.

First management server will take some time, so be\npatient. If a management server has multiple roles, you can update those while\nlogged in as well.\n\n### SQL-Scripts\n\nThe installation package will unpack these scripts under `%SystemDrive%\\Program\nFiles\\System Center 2012 R2\\Operations Manager\\Server\\SQL Script for Update\nRollups`. Run the `UR_Datawarehouse.sql` one on the OpsDW first, then the\n`Update_rollup_mom_db.sql` on OpsDB. If you're getting deadlocks, try again. If\nthat don't help, stop the management server services and try again. _Do not\ncontinue with the next script ​until you've succeeded with the first._\n\nIf you've installed UR3, the OpsDW-script is pretty quick (not sure if\nit's changed at all) and the OpsDB is a bit less prone to deadlocks.\n\n### Management Packs\n\nJust import the management packs from the %SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\System\nCenter 2012 R2\\Operations Manager\\Server\\Management Packs for Update Rollups\nfolder. Might have to retry as the console can do a little poor job of\ncalculating the dependencies.\n\n### Console\n\nThe easiest one, just install the MSP-file.\n\n### Gateway\n\nInstallation is a breeze. Make sure to check `%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\System\nCenter Operations Manager\\Gateway\\AgentManagement\\<architecture>` for updated\nagent files. If not, copy from same folder on any management server.\n\n### Web Console\n\nInstallation is very simple. Install the MSP from an administrative command\nprompt. If you're affected by [KB911722](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911722) and need the web console fixes, you\nneed to edit `%windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v2.0.50727\\CONFIG\\web.config`\nby adding the following line:\n\n`<machineKey validationKey=\"AutoGenerate,IsolateApps\"\ndecryptionKey=\"AutoGenerate,IsolateApps\" validation=\"3DES\" decryption=\"3DES\"/>`\n\n### Agents\n\nNormal update procedure applies. Use \"Pending Management\", SCCM, manual\ninstallations or whatever method you'd like.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf you already have UR3, this one is very quick.

There's a bunch of <abbr title=\"Microsoft Patch\">msp</abbr> files you install on the different server roles, a few SQL-scripts for the OpsDB and the OpsDW and some updated core management packs. I have used the following order and that has worked quite nicely.\n\n*   Management Servers (and locally installed consoles)\n*   SQL-Scripts\n*   Management Packs<sup id=\"fnref-818-2\">[1](#fn-818-2)</sup>\n*   Consoles<sup id=\"fnref-818-1\">[2](#fn-818-1)</sup>\n*   Gateway Servers<sup id=\"fnref2:818-1\">[2](#fn-818-1)</sup>\n*   Web Console<sup id=\"fnref3:818-1\">[2](#fn-818-1)</sup>\n*   Agents<sup id=\"fnref4:818-1\">[2](#fn-818-1)</sup>\n\nThe first management server takes the longest time as it will update the databases as well and you _must_ wait for it to complete before hitting any extra management servers. Otherwise the databases isn't marked as updated and multiple installations will try to update the same stuff at the same time, and that's generally bad. I'd recommend to never update more than one management server at the same time, although it is possible.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Management Servers\n\nFairly straight-forward. Run the <abbr title=\"Microsoft Patch\">msp</abbr>-file for the server update in an administrative command prompt and follow the wizard. First server takes a while (anything from 10-40 minutes depending on management group size and load in my experience). When that's done, move on to the next management server. If your management servers have multiple roles, like Console, Web Console or Reporting, go ahead and update those at once.\n\n### SQL-Scripts\n\nThe scripts are unpacked by the setup. You will find them under `%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\System Center 2012 R2\\Operations Manager\\Server\\SQL Script for Update Rollups`. Do OpsDW first using the `UR_Datawarehouse.sql` script, then go for OpsDB using `Update_rollup_mom_db.sql`. I've gotten the deadlock error on all installations so far and the best way to avoid that is to stop the management server services for this part. It's _absolutely crucial_ to have the scripts run to successful completion before running the next or moving on to any other server roles.\n\n### Console\n\nNothing out of the ordinary here, make sure you run the Console <abbr title=\"Microsoft Patch\">msp</abbr> in an administrative command prompt.\n\n### Management Packs\n\nThe updated core management packs are unpacked into `%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\System Center 2012 R2\\Operations Manager\\Server\\Management Packs for Update Rollups`. Import them using one of the updated consoles.\n\n### Gateway\n\nNext-next-next if running as administrator. Take effort to verify that the agent updates has been distributed into the `%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\System Center Operations Manager\\Gateway\\AgentManagement\\<architecture>` folder. If not, copy them from the same folder from any of the management servers.\n\n### Web Console\n\nNo problems so far as long as you run the Web Console <abbr title=\"Microsoft Patch\">msp</abbr> as administrator.\n\n### Agents\n\nUpdate them as usual, using \"Pending Management\", windows update, manual installation, <abbr title=\"System Center Configurations Manager\">SCCM</abbr> or whatever method you usually employ. Agent version will not be updated in the Console, but it will be visible under `Monitoring/Operations Manager/Agent Management/Agents by Version`.\n\n## Summary\n\nFairly simple update, the SQL Scripts can catch your off-guard if you do not know about them. Had some issues with Gateways, but it's a pretty quick update in most environments. Have not experienced any reboots or service outages on updated systems.\n\nGLHF!\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n* * *\n\n1.

But as others have discovered this \"feature\" as well--maybe \"hack\" would be a better name for it--I feel the need to explain how it works and also why you should not use it. Knowledge is power, and even if I advice against using this technique it is also a good way to understand how SCOM uses display-strings in management packs.\n\n## The Good News\n\nYes, you can use parameter replacement in you AlertName.\n\nWith \"parameter replacement\" i mean using some kind of substitute text, or mnemonic if you like, that at run-time get translated into something useful. If you have written any kind of alert generating rules or monitors, you most like included something like _$Data/Context/Property[@Name='SomeDataFromAPropertyBag']$_ into your alert description.\n\nIn this dialog, you also have the possibility to set the Alert Name. And if you are lazy, like I am, you probably also noticed that it is impossible to insert any kind of dynamic data into that field as well. This is especially annoying when you are writing a management pack that needs to look different in the Alert Views in the console, and you want to monitor 50 different Events or Performance counters or Log entries that are pretty much the same apart from a Name or ID.\nOf course I could not refrain from copy-pasting a _$Data/Context...$_ into the alert name only to realize that it simply is not being parsed and translated into the value of the specified parameter. Over time I have settled for a stand-point that it's probably a performance issue and I have also used that as an argument for this apparent lack of simplicity that some of my customers have been questioning.\n\nTwo, maybe three, years later. Microsoft releases an update to the core agent monitoring packs. Much to my surprise, one performance monitor suddenly generated alerts with a dynamic performance value in the Alert Name. You know, that field that is not gettingt parsed I was mentioning in the earlier paragraph. It actually looked pretty bad and made it very much impossible to practice any kind of alert supression, but still. It actually had a parsed value in the Alert Name.\nAs the lack of this feature had me irked before, I exported the core MP and started reading through the XML to find out how they did it. To my surprise, it was actually pretty simple if you ditched the Authoring Console and used your trusty text-editor instead.\n\n## How To Do It\n\nIn simple terms, if you know your SCOM XML out-side-in, you add the parameters to your \"Alert\" and modify your DisplayString, the one under LanguagePacks, to call that parameter by it's relative ID.\n\nJust in case you happen to be a regular mortal, here's the step-by-step guide. ;)\n\nIn this example I have created a silly-simple Alert Generating EventLog rule in wich I have added some parameters to the description. It pretty much looks like this:\n\n![Alert Description Dialog](http://teknoglotse.nfshost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ParamReplacement_AlertDescriptionDialog.png)\n\nSaving the MP at this point I will have a new WriteAlert action with a bunch of parameters and a displaystring with a unique ID.\nThe resulting XML-code for the WriteAlert action looks like this:\n\n```xml\n[xml highlight=\"7,8,9,10,11,12,13\"]\n<WriteAction ID=\"Alert\" TypeID=\"Health!System.Health.GenerateAlert\">\n  <Priority>1</Priority>\n  <Severity>2</Severity>\n  <AlertName />\n  <AlertDescription />\n  <AlertOwner />\n  <AlertMessageId>$MPElement[Name=\"TestMP.MyEventlogAlertRule.AlertMessage\"]$</AlertMessageId>\n  <AlertParameters>\n    <AlertParameter1>$Data/EventDescription$</AlertParameter1>\n    <AlertParameter2>$Data/LoggingComputer$</AlertParameter2>\n    <AlertParameter3>$Data/UserName$</AlertParameter3>\n    <AlertParameter4>$Data/EventNumber$</AlertParameter4>\n  </AlertParameters>\n  <Suppression />\n  <Custom1 />\n  <Custom2 />\n  <Custom3 />\n  <Custom4 />\n  <Custom5 />\n  <Custom6 />\n  <Custom7 />\n  <Custom8 />\n  <Custom9 />\n  <Custom10 />\n</WriteAction>\n```\n\nIn this slab of code, you've got the Parameters, their \"relative ID\" (the number in the Tag), and also the which is what you would need to search for among the displaystrings. Take note of the you want to use in your AlertName since you are going to need it later. A quick search for \"TestMP.MyEventlogAlertRule.AlertMessage\" will lead you to the actual message, which should looke similar to this:\n\n```xml\n<DisplayString ElementID=\"TestMP.MyEventlogAlertRule.AlertMessage\">\n  <Name>I want Parameter Replacement here:</Name>\n  <Description>Event Description: {0}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n  </Description>\n</DisplayString>\n```\n\nYou should have one of these for every language you have configured in your management pack.\nAs you may notice, the Description does not contain any XPaths of any kind but rather references to the parameters defined in the WriteAction. That would be the {X} thingies within the description tags. You may also notice that the AlertParameters starts from \"1\" while the parameter references begin with \"0\". In practice, that means that _{0}_ in the displaystring definition equals to _AlertParameter1_ and so forth.\n\nNow, with this in mind, adding a Parameter to AlertName if very simple and straight-forward. Simply decide which parameter your want to use and add it's reference to the Name definition.\nSo, let's say I have the above alert message and I want to include _UserName_ in the Alert Name, I would change the <Name> tag to:\n\n```xml\n<Name>I want Parameter Replacement here:{2}</Name>\n```\n\nThat's it folks!\nSave the XML, make sure you verify it and import it into your Operations Manager LAB and watch the magic. Just make sure you continue reading this post as the next part about the downsides is pretty important.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThe negative effects of using Parameter Replacement in AlertName really boils down to two main perspectives. These are, if I may say to, pretty major and is the reason I have been reluctant on posting this, sort of, how-to.\n\n### You are breaking your subscriptions and connectors\n\nApparently, parameter replacement is not working in subscriptions and connectors, be it 3:rd-party, Universal, Orchestrator IPs et.c. Basically anything other than the Operations Console will not be able to handle your parameters in AlertName. This will give you a _\"{1} in {2} has received an error\"_ instead of _\"veryimportant.log in C:\\Logs\\ImportantSystem\\ has received an error\"_ in anything except the Operations Console. Now, this might not be a bad thing if the Operations Console is your only interface to Operations Manager, but if you would like to forward these alerts to a mobile phone, IM user or a mail recipient it will be utterly useless. I have not verified this, but I am not sure if Alert Suppression is actually parsing the parameters as well. Also. If you, by means of connectors or System Center Orchestrator, are generating incidents from alerts the AlertName forwarded will be equally useless for anyone receiving it.\n\n### It's killing your health perspective\n\nMight sound drastic, but I'm quite serious about this. Using Parameter Replacement in AlertName might be useful for alert generating rules, but should never be used in a monitor. The reason is pretty simple actually. If you are using a monitor, you are without a doubt interested in it's state. Otherwise, you would not use a monitor, am I right? I cannot see how it would make sense to create a monitor that does not reflect the health of a specific checkpoint. Much less having a monitor generating alerts that might confuse any service desk operator about what monitor that caused the alert. Also--I have not tested this--I assume that a monitor would not update it's AlertName once the alert are generated making it more difficult to troubleshoot. Alert generating rules are, to me, something I tend to use only when all other options fail for some reason and I do not like to monitor things to cannot have health. And since parameters in AlertName is nothing for monitors I also question whether it actually is usable at all.\n\n## The Conclusion\n\nWhile this is an interesting techique and a good way to enjoy MP Authoring and learn about the behaviour of display strings and languages in you Management Packs, I would definitely consider it a mostly academical exercise. Only in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">extreme</span> use-cases and situations would I consider it a viably option and while it might look good in the console, do be aware of the limitations. I have also not seen anything about it on MSDN, and I have serious doubts about it being a supported feature. I have personally been using it in transition to a \"better\" management pack to get alerting running quickly, yet a prefered solution would actually be using a custom datasouce and a decent macro-enabled text-editor--not to mention snippets--to bulk-generate your monitors and/or rules.\n\n> MP Authoring\n\n> is fun and powerful\n\n> -- be resposible\n","source":"_posts/parameter-replacement-in-alertname.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Parameter Replacement in AlertName\ntags:\n  - MP Development\n  - OpsMgr\nid: 586\ncategories:\n  - Microsoft\n  - OpsMgr 2007\ndate: 2012-04-09 22:04:48\n---\n\n# ...and why you should not use it\n\n## A Disclaimer\n\nI have had serious doubts about actually writing this article for almost a year now for reasons that I will explain further on.

This will give you a <em>“{1} in {2} has received an error”</em> instead of <em>“veryimportant.log in C:\\Logs\\ImportantSystem\\ has received an error”</em> in anything except the Operations Console. Now, this might not be a bad thing if the Operations Console is your only interface to Operations Manager, but if you would like to forward these alerts to a mobile phone, IM user or a mail recipient it will be utterly useless. I have not verified this, but I am not sure if Alert Suppression is actually parsing the parameters as well. Also.

Using Parameter Replacement in AlertName might be useful for alert generating rules, but should never be used in a monitor. The reason is pretty simple actually. If you are using a monitor, you are without a doubt interested in it’s state. Otherwise, you would not use a monitor, am I right? I cannot see how it would make sense to create a monitor that does not reflect the health of a specific checkpoint. Much less having a monitor generating alerts that might confuse any service desk operator about what monitor that caused the alert. Also–I have not tested this–I assume that a monitor would not update it’s AlertName once the alert are generated making it more difficult to troubleshoot. Alert generating rules are, to me, something I tend to use only when all other options fail for some reason and I do not like to monitor things to cannot have health. And since parameters in AlertName is nothing for monitors I also question whether it actually is usable at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Conclusion\"><a href=\"#The-Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Conclusion\"></a>The Conclusion</h2><p>While this is an interesting techique and a good way to enjoy MP Authoring and learn about the behaviour of display strings and languages in you Management Packs, I would definitely consider it a mostly academical exercise. Only in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">extreme</span> use-cases and situations would I consider it a viably option and while it might look good in the console, do be aware of the limitations. I have also not seen anything about it on MSDN, and I have serious doubts about it being a supported feature. I have personally been using it in transition to a “better” management pack to get alerting running quickly, yet a prefered solution would actually be using a custom datasouce and a decent macro-enabled text-editor–not to mention snippets–to bulk-generate your monitors and/or rules.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MP Authoring</p>\n<p>is fun and powerful</p>\n<p>– be resposible</p>\n</blockquote>\n","excerpt":"","more":"<h1 id=\"…and-why-you-should-not-use-it\"><a href=\"#…and-why-you-should-not-use-it\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"…and why you should not use it\"></a>…and why you should not use it</h1><h2 id=\"A-Disclaimer\"><a href=\"#A-Disclaimer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A Disclaimer\"></a>A Disclaimer</h2><p>I have had serious doubts about actually writing this article for almost a year now for reasons that I will explain further on. But as others have discovered this “feature” as well–maybe “hack” would be a better name for it–I feel the need to explain how it works and also why you should not use it. Knowledge is power, and even if I advice against using this technique it is also a good way to understand how SCOM uses display-strings in management packs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Good-News\"><a href=\"#The-Good-News\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Good News\"></a>The Good News</h2><p>Yes, you can use parameter replacement in you AlertName.</p>\n<p>With “parameter replacement” i mean using some kind of substitute text, or mnemonic if you like, that at run-time get translated into something useful. If you have written any kind of alert generating rules or monitors, you most like included something like <em>$Data/Context/Property[@Name=’SomeDataFromAPropertyBag’]$</em> into your alert description.</p>\n<p>In this dialog, you also have the possibility to set the Alert Name. And if you are lazy, like I am, you probably also noticed that it is impossible to insert any kind of dynamic data into that field as well. This is especially annoying when you are writing a management pack that needs to look different in the Alert Views in the console, and you want to monitor 50 different Events or Performance counters or Log entries that are pretty much the same apart from a Name or ID.<br>Of course I could not refrain from copy-pasting a <em>$Data/Context…$</em> into the alert name only to realize that it simply is not being parsed and translated into the value of the specified parameter. Over time I have settled for a stand-point that it’s probably a performance issue and I have also used that as an argument for this apparent lack of simplicity that some of my customers have been questioning.</p>\n<p>Two, maybe three, years later. Microsoft releases an update to the core agent monitoring packs. Much to my surprise, one performance monitor suddenly generated alerts with a dynamic performance value in the Alert Name. You know, that field that is not gettingt parsed I was mentioning in the earlier paragraph.

At least, that's where I've come across them both.\n\nHow will this affect me, then?\nNot very much it would seem. Here's what VizionCore says about their part:\n> “The completion of this acquisition signals another major step in Vizioncore’s evolution and growth in the virtualization market,” said David Bieneman, CEO of VizionCore. “While maintaining the autonomy that has made us successful, we will also be able to leverage technologies developed by and acquired by Quest, such as Invirtus and Provision Networks, to enhance and expand the feature sets of VizionCore products. This is very positive news for virtualization customers who will enjoy a richer and robust product set that will help them achieve greater levels of ROI from their investments in virtualization platforms.”\n\nIn my head, this means that VizionCore will still be VizionCore but with, perhaps, tighter integration with Invirtus. Invirtus was, by the way, a \"Strategic Partner\" to VizionCore even before the acquisition.\n\neXc then? Well. It is not clearly stated in the press-release as far as I can tell. We can only hope that they will make the decision to rebuild their not-even-web1.0 excuse for a website. And what the hell is up with that logo? Fortunately for us, their design skills -- or lack thereof -- does not reflect their programming skills. But still... no sane man or woman uses Comic Sans in a logo. Not even jokingly.

This is very positive news for virtualization customers who will enjoy a richer and robust product set that will help them achieve greater levels of ROI from their investments in virtualization platforms.”\n\nIn my head, this means that VizionCore will still be VizionCore but with, perhaps, tighter integration with Invirtus. Invirtus was, by the way, a \"Strategic Partner\" to VizionCore even before the acquisition.\n\neXc then? Well. It is not clearly stated in the press-release as far as I can tell. We can only hope that they will make the decision to rebuild their not-even-web1.0 excuse for a website. And what the hell is up with that logo? Fortunately for us, their design skills -- or lack thereof -- does not reflect their programming skills. But still... no sane man or woman uses Comic Sans in a logo. Not even jokingly.

Prerequisites for this script is that you have identified which COM-port to use and it's supported baud-rates and whether it supports DTR or not. If you do not know what the hell I am talking about, you could probably have it work with my preconfigured settings anyway. If you are unsure about if your modem supports AT commands you could open a serial connection to the modem using Hyperterminal or PuTTY and run AT+CMGF=1\\. If supported, the return should be OK. If it is not supported (you get ERROR instead) you would have to use PDU-mode which require a bit of hex-encoding of your messages. This is nothing I have had to do yet and will not be including in this script. Maybe in the future. Maybe.\n\nSo, looking a some powershelling then. First thing would be to connect to the modem.\n\n```powershell\n# Create your instance of the SerialPort Class\n$serialPort = new-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort\n# Set various COM-port settings\n$serialPort.PortName = \"COM1\"\n$serialPort.BaudRate = 19200\n$serialPort.WriteTimeout = 500\n$serialPort.ReadTimeout = 3000\n$serialPort.DtrEnable = \"true\"\n# Open the connection\n$serialPort.Open()\n```\n\nWith the connection established, you the set to modem in AT-mode and start sending the message to the modem.\n\n```powershell\n# Tell the modem you want to use AT-mode\n$serialPort.Write(\"AT+CMGF=1`r`n\")\n\n# Start feeding message data to the modem\n# Begin with the phone number, international\n# style and a <CL>... that's the `r`n part\n$serialPort.Write(\"AT+CMGS=`\"+46888888888`\"`r`n\")\n\n# Now, write the message to the modem\n$serialPort.Write(\"This is a test!`r`n\")\n\n# Send a Ctrl+Z to end the message.\n$serialPort.Write($([char] 26))\n```\n\nAs you may notice, the message is only stored in the modems memory until you send a Ctrl+z which will end the message and send it. It is possible to add more text to the message before sending it if you would like. Personally, I prefer to store the message into a regular powershell variable and pass that one to the script. The SerialPort library is sort of clever and a local phone number will probably work. For safety, I always use international number with country code as it will work every time.\n\nOnly thing left now is to close the serial port connection and end the script.

clean production-ready version as of yet… and people has been asking about how far off the article is.</p>\n<p>What this script does is to send a text message using a GSM/GPRS modem connected to a local (or LAN-connected with local drivers) serial port using Powershell.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Disclaimer\"><a href=\"#Disclaimer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Disclaimer!\"></a>Disclaimer!</h1><p>This script “works” but is not fit for production. See it as an example of the general concept to evolve and adapt into something worthy of production use.</p>\n<p>What’s missing in the latest iteration is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A working Event-Handler to deal with asynchronous call-backs.</li>\n<li>Support for AT+MSGW (write to modem memory)</li>\n<li>Reusing messages in modem memory for multiple recipients.</li>\n<li>Various error- and exeption-handlers.</li>\n<li>Actually verifying that the modem is AT-capable.</li>\n<li>Querying the system for available modems and their ports.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"The-Script\"><a href=\"#The-Script\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Script\"></a>The Script</h1><p>So, a short note before digging into the script. Prerequisites for this script is that you have identified which COM-port to use and it’s supported baud-rates and whether it supports DTR or not. If you do not know what the hell I am talking about, you could probably have it work with my preconfigured settings anyway. If you are unsure about if your modem supports AT commands you could open a serial connection to the modem using Hyperterminal or PuTTY and run AT+CMGF=1. If supported, the return should be OK. If it is not supported (you get ERROR instead) you would have to use PDU-mode which require a bit of hex-encoding of your messages. This is nothing I have had to do yet and will not be including in this script. Maybe in the future. Maybe.</p>\n<p>So, looking a some powershelling then. First thing would be to connect to the modem.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight powershell\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Create your instance of the SerialPort Class</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span> = <span class=\"built_in\">new-Object</span> System.IO.Ports.SerialPort</div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Set various COM-port settings</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.PortName = <span class=\"string\">\"COM1\"</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.BaudRate = <span class=\"number\">19200</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.WriteTimeout = <span class=\"number\">500</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.ReadTimeout = <span class=\"number\">3000</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.DtrEnable = <span class=\"string\">\"true\"</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Open the connection</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.Open()</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>With the connection established, you the set to modem in AT-mode and start sending the message to the modem.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight powershell\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Tell the modem you want to use AT-mode</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.Write(<span class=\"string\">\"AT+CMGF=1`r`n\"</span>)</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Start feeding message data to the modem</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Begin with the phone number, international</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># style and a &lt;CL&gt;... that's the `r`n part</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.Write(<span class=\"string\">\"AT+CMGS=`\"+46888888888`\"`r`n\"</span>)</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Now, write the message to the modem</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.Write(<span class=\"string\">\"This is a test!`r`n\"</span>)</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># Send a Ctrl+Z to end the message.</span></div><div class=\"line\"><span class=\"variable\">$serialPort</span>.Write($([char] <span class=\"number\">26</span>))</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>As you may notice, the message is only stored in the modems memory until you send a Ctrl+z which will end the message and send it.

The SerialPort library is sort of clever and a local phone number will probably work. For safety, I always use international number with country code as it will work every time.</p>\n<p>Only thing left now is to close the serial port connection and end the script.

You could probably call me naïve for that but logically we should not encourage this trend. This is my appeal to all exhibitors of future conferences to re-evaluate the concept of booth-babes.\n\nI will not go into the genus-political part of this discussion as of now--others are more eloquent and fit to handle that--but rather some of the more pragmatic sides to ditch the BB (short for Booth-Babe) and how that would gain us visitors as well as the exhibitors. I will also keep a pretty frank, and perhaps impolite, tone in this rant of mine.\n\nSo, here's my top reasons, in no particular order, to give up the BBs.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Reason #1 - BBs is disrupting the purpose of the exhibition\n\nWhen I go to a conference, I am there for the tech, to network and shake paws with the people I collaborate with on-line. It is also a good place to meet the actual corporations that I do business with and discuss their products between four eyes.\nI do not want to plow through a crowd of great white whales [Oops! I meant \"males\"] ogling the BBs to get to someone with actual knowledge about the products and solutions at hand.\n\n## Reason #2 - BBs are alienating the visitors\n\nIf you are a heterosexual male or a homosexual female, the BBs can actually make you embarrassed, shy and unwilling to approach the exhibitor for that sole reason.\nIf you are not, you might find an exhibitor with BBs appalling and take another route for that sole reason.\n\n## Reason #3 - BBs are intimidating the female visitors\n\nThere is, of course, exceptions to this, but I actually discussed this matter with a couple of gentlewomen in the alumni lounge and they did say that they are both appalled and intimidated to the slightly clad BBs at one particular booth at this years MMS. They even used terms like \"ridiculous\" and \"waste of space\" to describe the phenomena.\nNow, I believe I can hear some of you readers thinking \"what? Nice addition to the boring screens and ...\". But imaging the opposite for a while. Imagine a whole bunch of Booth-Hunks instead. You know, Brad Pitt in Fight Club and the likes. I know I would be intimidated by that kind of display.\n\n## Reason #4 - BBs makes it hard to know who to talk to\n\nBecause of the BBs, it can at time be hard to know if the lady at the booth just happen to be a nice-looking knowledgeable tech-specialist or simply someone there for eye-candy. Too many times have I had a conversation like this:\n\n```text\n- \"Hi! So, tell me about [SystemX]. It looks kinda interesting on paper.\"\n- \"Hi! Uh, oh! Yeah! You should probably be talking to that guy over there. I don't really know anything about their stuff.\"\n```\n\nI hate it. I want to be able to pick anyone in the booth and get a cohesive answer. You cannot be expert on everything and some people are more marketing focused, but at least they can give you the big picture before calling some techy fellow. Last year I had a really nice discussion with a nice lady from EMC that later led to get access to to some beta code. Unfortunately, I had by then grown tired of the BBs and merely approached her since there were lines to the male exhibitors. Which brings me to...\n\n## Reason #5 - Having BBs is disrespecting your female colleagues.\n\nThere you are. You most certainly have some very talented women in your development teams--my experience is that's where you'll find most of them, as architects and lead developers--but for some reason your decide to hire a bunch of BBs to \"spice it up a little\", \"draw a little crowd\", \"get the attention\" and so forth. Do you really think your female colleagues appreciate that? Isn't that diminishing their talent a bit? I am sure that those who attend conferences for technical reasons and to do a bit of networking would take a nice technical discussion with anyone, however geeky she/he might be, rather than side-stepping a crowd or some figure-head on my way there.\n\nI don't know. Maybe I am alone in this matter, but I'd really like to see this change. I would really like to see vendors and exhibitors trying to dazzle the visitors with great displays, clever uses of software and mind-blowing products and not scantily clad women.\n\nAh, well.

You tell Operations Manager to change Primary Management Server for AGENTX from GW1 to GW2.\n1. The SDK Service (i guess) tells GW1 that \"You're no longer the Primary Management Server for AGENTX\"\n1. GW1 acknowledges this and stops talking to AGENTX.  And I mean _Completely_ stops talking to AGENTX.\n1. OpsMgr then tells GW2 to start accepting communication from AGENTX.\n1. OpsMgr tries to tell AGENTX that it should talk to GW2 since GW1 won't listen.\n\nSpotted the problem?\nThis modus operandi probably works when agents are on the same network and in the same domain where fail-over is sort of automatic.  The problem we are facing now is that the server are telling the Gateway to stop accepting communications to and from the agent _before_ the agent is notified that there is a new Gateway server to talk to. The agent will continue to talk to GW1 but will be completely ignored and you will probably start seeing events in the Operations Manager eventlog on GW1 with EventID 20000.\n\nHow do I get around this little _feature_ then?\n\nNo matter if you found this article after running into the mentioned troubles or if you are googling ahead of time to be prepared, the fix is the same and consists of a few powershell scripts. These scripts are [out there](http://www.systemcentercentral.com/Forums/tabid/60/IndexID/19305/Default.aspx#vwcComments19305 \"System Center Central\") allready, but in different contexts, hence this post.\n\n## First step:  Install the new Gateway\n\n[Documentation on this](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb432149.aspx \"Deploying Gateway Server in the Multiple Server, Single Management Group Scenario\") from Microsoft is good enough, but here's the short version.\n\n1. Verify name resolution to and from Gateway server and Management Server\n1. [Create certificate](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb735408.aspx \"Authentication and Data Encryption for Windows Computers in Operations Manager 2007\") for the Gateway server\n1. Approve the Gateway server\n1. Install Gateway server\n1. Import certificates on Windows system\n1. Run MOMCertImport.exe on Gateway server to add the certificate into Gateway server configuration\n1. Wait\n\nThe wait is for the gateway server to get all needed configuration from RMS and to download all neccesary management packs, run all the discovery scripts and so on.

Any will do, as long as it's connected to the correct Management Group.\nThen run the following script:\n\n```powershell\n$primaryGW= Get-ManagementServer | where {$_.Name -eq 'GW2.domain.local'}\n$failoverGw = Get-ManagementServer | where {$_.Name -eq 'GW1.domain.local'}\n$agents = Get-Agent | where {$_.primarymanagementservername -eq 'GW1.domain.local'}\nSet-ManagementServer -AgentManagedComputer: $agents -PrimaryManagementServer: $primaryGW -FailoverServer: $failoverGw\n```\n\nRemember to change \"GW1.domain.local\" to you OLD Gateway servername and \"GW2.domain.local\" to your NEW Gateway servername.\n\nIf you don't know powershell, this script basically configures all agents using the old Gateway to use the new one as primare, but keep the old one as a fail-over server. The Gateways will still get to know the changes before the agents, but since the old on is still listening to the agents (though, as the fail-over host) it will be able to tell them to go to the new one, GW2.","source":"_posts/replacechange-a-gateway-server.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Replace/Change a Gateway Server\ntags:\n  - How-To\n  - OpsMgr\n  - PoSH\n  - Script\nid: 207\ncategories:\n  - Microsoft\n  - OpsMgr 2007\ndate: 2009-09-24 12:32:35\n---\n\n# Description of problem\n\nIf you are looking into replacing an (or just switching to another primary) Operations Manager 2007 Gateway Server for any reason, there's a little more to consider than just right-clicking the clients and selecting \"Change Primary Management Server\" in the Operations Console.\nYou could end up with agents not being able to connect to the Management Group at all due to a small problem with the order in which Operations Manager do things.\n\nHere's basically what happens:\n\n1. You tell Operations Manager to change Primary Management Server for AGENTX from GW1 to GW2.\n1.

Mostly due to the facts that I am really bad with SNMP and how it works, I've never really looked into the inner working of building an SNMP management pack and also because we ran into a couple of errors preventing the discovery process to work alright.\n\nTo make it clear right away, this is not going to be a \"Building an SNMP Management Pack Tutorial\" since there's plentiful good ones out there already, and to be extra helpful I'm gonna include a few links right away:\n\n* [SNMP Setup and Simple Custom SNMP Discovery](http://www.systemcentercentral.com/BlogDetails/tabid/143/IndexID/66140/Default.aspx \"SNMP Setup and Simple Custom SNMP Discovery\") - Pretty much the basics\n* [SNMP Management Pack Example: NetApp Management Pack](http://www.systemcentercentral.com/BlogDetails/tabid/143/IndexID/58919/Default.aspx \"SNMP Management Pack Example: NetApp Management Pack for SCOM 2007 R2 part 4\") - Part 4 actually, but has the links to the other parts\n* [Creating SNMP Probe Based Monitors](http://www.systemcentercentral.com/Details/tabid/147/IndexID/58815/Default.aspx \"Creating SNMP Probe Based Monitors\") - No custom discovery, but a good and simple guide to SNMP Probes\n\nIt's the second, the NetApp one, I've used as a guide to building the UPS management pack since it goes through the process of building your own filtered discovery using SystemOID to identify your hardware-classes and then building the monitors on top of those.\n\n# Let's get to it\n\nWhen building the discovery of my hardware classes I ran into problems. The discovery simply did not work. At first I got some strange errors about \"invalid queries\", something that turned out to be related to me reading two guides--seriously though, pick one guide that is closest to what you want to achieve and stick to it--and mixing up the XPathQuery variables. Silly me.\nI got those errors to go away and I was able to get a few objects to my base-class, but none of the hardware classes who was populated through the return value of an SNMP OID got discovered.\nThe only error I got this time was the following:\n\n```text\nLog Name:      Operations Manager\nSource:        Health Service Modules\nDate:          2010-09-02 11:19:12\nEvent ID:      11001\nTask Category: None\nLevel:         Error\nKeywords:      Classic\nUser:          N/A\nComputer:      CENSORED\nDescription:\nError sending an SNMP GET message to IP Address XX.XX.XX.XX, Community String:=CENSORED, Status 0x6c.\n\nOne or more workflows were affected by this.\n\nWorkflow name: CENSORED.MP.CLASS.DISCOVERY\nInstance name: CENSORED_DEVICENAME\nInstance ID: {5C7EFB30-D885-8843-0DD7-EA86B4FD2311}\nManagement group: CENSORED\n```\n\nI went through all the other logical steps of troubleshooting an error like that which include double-checking firewall settings, OIDs, IP-addresses, allowed hosts and so forth. It wasn't until I loaded the [PowerMIB](http://www.networkupstools.org/protocols/eaton/ \"EATON Protocol Library\") into a MIB Browser installed on the proxy machine (in this case a Management Server) I realized that there was no problem sending an SNMP GET to the UPS from that server.

Pfffft! [#opsmgr #squaredup]","id":"835","date":"2014-09-09T14:38:36.000Z","_content":"\n# Story-time\n\nI saw [SquaredUp](http://www.squaredup.com/ \"SquaredUp\") some year or two ago while googling about on behalf of a customer looking for a dashboard kind of thingy. It looked good and fairly simple, but for some reason it never clicked with the customer and we ended up going for some custom-made dashboards with a little scripting and some <abbr title=\"Database\">DB</abbr>-queries. I kind of liked the look of their product though and have kept an eye on them now and then. \nFast-forward to may 21st this year and the [release of version 1.8](http://www.squaredup.com/blog/proudly-announcing-squared-v18 \"Proudly Announcing v1.8\") and a whole slew of [nifty little features](http://www.squaredup.com/blog/squared-v18-new-features \"New Features in v1.8\"). What specifically piqued my interest was the linked dashboards, SharePoint integration and the included SLA and Map plugins. This basically ticked a lot of boxes many of my customers have looked for and something we've normally been looking into... err... _other products_ for. That, coupled with some new videos on their [Youtube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SquaredUpLtd \"SquaredUp YouTube Channel\"), a few well-placed tweets and a little mail-correspondence had me setting it up in my portable little lab.\n\nOne of the interesting points is how, supposedly easy, it is to set the portal up. So I reset my lab -- <abbr title=\"Powershell Deployment Toolkit\">PDT</abbr> is just wonderful -- and decided to go for the hail-dummy approach. No manual, no preparations, no check-lists... Next-next-next then hopefully a working portal.\n<!--more-->\n\n# The Installation\n\nFirst, download the installation file (yes, singular) through the link you've got in your email and save it somewhere proper.\n![SquaredUp - Installation Package](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152402_0001.png \"SquaredUp - Installation Package\")\n\nDoubleclicked the installation packaged and it now tells me it will install a few pre-requisites and configure the website for me. Next!\n\n![Installation Information](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152428_0002.png \"SquaredUp - Something something components\")\n\nThe <abbr title=\"End User License Agreement\">EULA</abbr> I am sure each one of you are reading. Next!\n![EULA](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152447_0003.png \"SquaredUp - Yeah, mhm... Read it.\")\n\nInstalling, or rather configuring, <abbr title=\"Internet Information Services\">IIS</abbr> and pre-requisites for me. Very nice. Next!\n\n![Installing/Configuring IIS](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152506_0004.png \"SquaredUp - installing IIS for me... nice.\")\n\nQuick summary before actual installation. Next!\n\n![Installation Summary](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152525_0005.png \"SquaredUp - Webroot... ok, sure.\")\n\nThis step actually requires a little action on your part. In this installation, the default setting \"localhost\" would actually work but I prefer to actually configure these things properly. I only have a single Management Server in this lab, so testing a load-balanced highly available scenario was not possible. Enter Management Server name, then Next!\n\n![Configuring the Management Server](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152612_0006.png \"SquaredUp - Configure Management Server\")\n\nAfter a slight case of progress-bar the installation is now complete. Click link and exit the installer. Time spent so far is less than ten minutes, probably closer to five.\nNow it's time to login using your normal <abbr title=\"System Center 2012 - Operations Manager\">SCOM</abbr> credentials.\n\n![Login Screen](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152750_0008.png \"SquaredUp - Login Screen\")\n\nFirst login will bring you to the Activation Screen. Simply paste the activation key from the email and Activate. This requires a working internet connection.\n\n![Activation Screen](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/153833_0010.png \"SquaredUp - Activation Screen\")\n\nThat's it! Well... not really. Navigating the portal I noticed that the spark-lines aren't showing, and hitting the \"View Performance\" link on an object view gives me a \"Login failed for user...\" error. I know I saw something about configuring the Data Warehouse in the email, so I check the blissfully simple Settings panel.\n![Settings Panel - DW Configuration](http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/154502_0012.png \"SquaredUp - Configure DW Help\")\n\nFollowed the [instructions](http://support.squaredup.com/support/solutions/articles/27999 \"Squared Up - Configuring Data Warehouse Permissions\") to configure the security of the OperationsManagerDW database for the SquaredUp web application, and that's really it. Portal is up and running, spark-lines working. Ready to go.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI wish more products and \"add-ons\" to <abbr title=\"System Center 2012 - Operations Manager\">SCOM</abbr> were this easy to install. No extra databases, no extra permissions, no extra infrastructure. I would like to try it out in a larger environment and see what the load on the website, the databases and the data access service will be. It would also be necessary to verify that it works properly when the management servers are behind a load balancer and maybe even putting the SquaredUp portal behind one itself. Since there is not a lot of configuration to be done and no database, it _should_ work. We'll see.\n\nNext up will be fiddling about with custom dashboards, maps, and generally figuring out what else we can do.","source":"_posts/squaredup-installation.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'SquaredUp Installation - Manual?

This basically ticked a lot of boxes many of my customers have looked for and something we’ve normally been looking into… err… <em>other products</em> for. That, coupled with some new videos on their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SquaredUpLtd\" title=\"SquaredUp YouTube Channel\">Youtube-channel</a>, a few well-placed tweets and a little mail-correspondence had me setting it up in my portable little lab.</p>\n<p>One of the interesting points is how, supposedly easy, it is to set the portal up. So I reset my lab – <abbr title=\"Powershell Deployment Toolkit\">PDT</abbr> is just wonderful – and decided to go for the hail-dummy approach. No manual, no preparations, no check-lists… Next-next-next then hopefully a working portal.<br>","more":"</p>\n<h1 id=\"The-Installation\"><a href=\"#The-Installation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Installation\"></a>The Installation</h1><p>First, download the installation file (yes, singular) through the link you’ve got in your email and save it somewhere proper.<br><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152402_0001.png\" alt=\"SquaredUp - Installation Package\" title=\"SquaredUp - Installation Package\"></p>\n<p>Doubleclicked the installation packaged and it now tells me it will install a few pre-requisites and configure the website for me. Next!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152428_0002.png\" alt=\"Installation Information\" title=\"SquaredUp - Something something components\"></p>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"End User License Agreement\">EULA</abbr> I am sure each one of you are reading.

Read it.\"></p>\n<p>Installing, or rather configuring, <abbr title=\"Internet Information Services\">IIS</abbr> and pre-requisites for me. Very nice. Next!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152506_0004.png\" alt=\"Installing/Configuring IIS\" title=\"SquaredUp - installing IIS for me... nice.\"></p>\n<p>Quick summary before actual installation. Next!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152525_0005.png\" alt=\"Installation Summary\" title=\"SquaredUp - Webroot... ok, sure.\"></p>\n<p>This step actually requires a little action on your part. In this installation, the default setting “localhost” would actually work but I prefer to actually configure these things properly. I only have a single Management Server in this lab, so testing a load-balanced highly available scenario was not possible. Enter Management Server name, then Next!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152612_0006.png\" alt=\"Configuring the Management Server\" title=\"SquaredUp - Configure Management Server\"></p>\n<p>After a slight case of progress-bar the installation is now complete. Click link and exit the installer. Time spent so far is less than ten minutes, probably closer to five.<br>Now it’s time to login using your normal <abbr title=\"System Center 2012 - Operations Manager\">SCOM</abbr> credentials.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152750_0008.png\" alt=\"Login Screen\" title=\"SquaredUp - Login Screen\"></p>\n<p>First login will bring you to the Activation Screen. Simply paste the activation key from the email and Activate. This requires a working internet connection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/153833_0010.png\" alt=\"Activation Screen\" title=\"SquaredUp - Activation Screen\"></p>\n<p>That’s it! Well… not really. Navigating the portal I noticed that the spark-lines aren’t showing, and hitting the “View Performance” link on an object view gives me a “Login failed for user…” error. I know I saw something about configuring the Data Warehouse in the email, so I check the blissfully simple Settings panel.<br><img src=\"http://www.teknoglot.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/154502_0012.png\" alt=\"Settings Panel - DW Configuration\" title=\"SquaredUp - Configure DW Help\"></p>\n<p>Followed the <a href=\"http://support.squaredup.com/support/solutions/articles/27999\" title=\"Squared Up - Configuring Data Warehouse Permissions\">instructions</a> to configure the security of the OperationsManagerDW database for the SquaredUp web application, and that’s really it. Portal is up and running, spark-lines working. Ready to go.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>I wish more products and “add-ons” to <abbr title=\"System Center 2012 - Operations Manager\">SCOM</abbr> were this easy to install. No extra databases, no extra permissions, no extra infrastructure. I would like to try it out in a larger environment and see what the load on the website, the databases and the data access service will be. It would also be necessary to verify that it works properly when the management servers are behind a load balancer and maybe even putting the SquaredUp portal behind one itself. Since there is not a lot of configuration to be done and no database, it <em>should</em> work. We’ll see.</p>\n<p>Next up will be fiddling about with custom dashboards, maps, and generally figuring out what else we can do.</p>"},{"title":"The TCP Port Check: Use with caution!","id":"202","date":"2009-08-27T12:39:43.000Z","_content":"\nJust wanted to raise a word of caution about the TCP Port Check in Operations Manager 2007.\n\nSome customers have notices the the system-logs on some Unix machines are completely swamped with \"connection error\", \"TCP Connect failed\", \"TCP Session Lost\" and similar and after a bit och research the problematic servers were narrowed down to those monitored by Operations Manager.

Message Queuing provides guaranteed delivery, efficient routing, security, and priority based messaging.</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now, what’s really interesting is what you will find in the MP Guide under “Supported Configurations”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Message Queuing Management Pack for Operations Manager 2007 is designed to monitor Message Queuing version 3 only.</p>\n<p>The Message Queuing Management Pack supports the following platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows Server 2003</li>\n<li>Windows XP</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>The Message Queuing Management Pack also supports monitoring clustered MSMQ components</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Emphasis by me.</p>\n<p>Finally, MSMQ monitoring seems to be cluster aware, which might mean that the home-made pack i did to have those (numerous) queues covered could be passed on to the scrap-heap. This is also confirmed under “Changes in This Update”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The December 2009 update to this management pack includes the following change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a problem when working with an instance of MSMQ in a Cluster. The MP is now able to discover and monitor public and private queues in a cluster.</li>\n<li>Fixed a problem when discovering the local and cluster instance of MSMQ. The MP is now able to discover and monitor both instances.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The confusing double RunAs profiles seems to have been cleaned up too (you only have to worry about one now) as well as fixing some sloppy mistakes in the previous scripts (no Option Explicit? C’mon Microsoft! You <em>write</em> the best practices, try to stick to them.) and generally improving display and documentation.</p>\n<p>Gonna import this to our staging environment today and let it roll during the holidays.</p>\n<p>Download and documentation:<br><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1D2B4398-8BC2-4A43-850C-852EBB0D983B&amp;displaylang=en&amp;displaylang=en\" title=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1D2B4398-8BC2-4A43-850C-852EBB0D983B&amp;displaylang=en&amp;displaylang=en\">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1D2B4398-8BC2-4A43-850C-852EBB0D983B&amp;displaylang=en&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>\n<p>Cheers!

It’s for free!","id":"195","date":"2009-08-21T08:38:55.000Z","_content":"\n# Background\n\nI get this question every now and then and every time I find myself completely flabbergasted and having to look things up once again. To avoid wasting my time on the same question once again and perhaps help others doing the same, here’s a little guidance.\n\nDon’t get me wrong now.\nSQL Express has it’s applications and for a free database server, it’s not half-bad. Small development sites, minor, not that extremely important systems with lower performance and feature demands, minor website databases et cetera could do well with SQL Express.\n\n## My Checklist\n\nHere’s my list of questions you have to ask to find if SQL Express is the correct choice.\n\n### 1. Do your applications support SQL Express?\n\nIf your application developers cannot say “Yes” to this, you’re out of luck. You could probably get their applications to run on SQL Express anyway, but application support if something goes bad will most likely be zilch.\n\n### 2. Do your applications fit the hardware limitations?\n\nSQL Express is limited to 1GB RAM, 1 CPU and 4GB of databases. 1GB of RAM seems a bit tight to me for any production data. Also, on SQL Express 2005, [according to Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345154%28SQL.90%29.aspx#sseover_topic4), you cannot run parallel queries.\n\n> ”SQL Server Express can install and run on multiprocessor machines, but only a single CPU is used at any time. Internally, the engine limits the number of user scheduler threads to 1 so that only 1 CPU is used at a time. Features such as parallel query execution are not supported because of the single CPU limit.”\n\nIf this is still true on SQL Express 2008, I don’t know and I haven’t found any information about it (yet).\n\nWhen answering this question, remember to calculate expected growth and possibly new databases/applications too.\n\n### 2. Do your applications use database replication?\n\n  If, so. Do the new server need to act as a publisher? If, yes, then you’re out of luck. SQL Express do handle database replication, but only as a subscriber. If you need to publish data, then you need a “bigger” SQL Edition.\n\n### 4. Do you need Database Mail?\n\nSQL Express does not have Database Mail. You have to find other ways to code your notifications. This question has raised counter-questions from customers as to “What would I need Database Mail for?”. It is, evidently a feature not used by many. Personally, I find it useful. [Clay McDonald has a nice blog-post](http://claysql.blogspot.com/2009/02/send-database-mail-from-trigger.html) on how to make SQL-triggers send mail on, for instance, inserts into a table using Database Mail. You could of course have it send mail on deletions as well. In my mind, this might come in handy in user-databases in CRM- or HR-systems. Every time an employee gets deleted from the database, the HR-admin could receive a notification.\n\n### 5. Do you need the SQL Agent?\n\nPerhaps not. Maybe you feel comfortable with scheduling your database backups using the windows scheduler and homebrew scripts. Just make sure your monitoring software (or IT-personnel) discover when the script fails. An increasing amount of applications require the SQL Agent to schedule and monitor recurring tasks, like Microsoft's App-V. Without the SQL Agent, the databases would grow ad infinitum. How about index maintenance? This is also possible to go by using your own scripts and the windows scheduler. SQL Express can do most maintenance tasks you would need using scripts and T-SQL. The SQL Agent just makes it simpler and more manageable. Once again, double-check this with the application developer.\n\n### 6. Do you application use SSIS/DTS-jobs?\n\nThis is not included in SQL Express. Maybe there’s a work-around, but I haven’t found it and I doubt it is supported by anyone.\n\n### 7. Do you need to be able to troubleshoot performance problems?\n\nYou can do this on SQL Express with a great deal of knowledge and timers. The SQL-profiler, the Performance Data Collection and the Database Tuning Advisor makes it easier. Specifically, the SQL-profiler comes in really handy when you suspect the application (not the system) to be the bad guy since you can trace the queries and pin-point where the performance-hit resides. Using the SQL-profiler I have been able to optimise indexes to and thus making database servers go from a 98% CPU Load to 3% CPU Load. I have also been able to pin-point specific queries and use them as “evidence” that the problem is bad/sloppy code rather than problems with the database server. Also, using the SQL-profiler.\n\nThere’s more, of course, but these point are the most common pit-falls in my experience. As you can see, there’s three “do you need”-questions  and there are highly optional. Far from everyone use them and often because of lacking SQL Server knowledge. You don’t know what you can do. Still, the most important question is #1\\. Is SQL Express a supported database server for your applications. Hopefully, the developer knows the answer to this directly. No maybe’s. Yes or No.\n\nPersonally, I find that If you need a database server for production data, don’t go for SQL Express. Many customers have gone that way because “it’s free!” just to find themselves in the midst of a SQL Server upgrade and database migration a year later.","source":"_posts/whynotusesqlexpress-itsforfree.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Why not use SQL Express?

Also, on SQL Express 2005, [according to Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345154%28SQL.90%29.aspx#sseover_topic4), you cannot run parallel queries.\n\n> ”SQL Server Express can install and run on multiprocessor machines, but only a single CPU is used at any time. Internally, the engine limits the number of user scheduler threads to 1 so that only 1 CPU is used at a time. Features such as parallel query execution are not supported because of the single CPU limit.”\n\nIf this is still true on SQL Express 2008, I don’t know and I haven’t found any information about it (yet).\n\nWhen answering this question, remember to calculate expected growth and possibly new databases/applications too.\n\n### 2. Do your applications use database replication?\n\n  If, so. Do the new server need to act as a publisher? If, yes, then you’re out of luck. SQL Express do handle database replication, but only as a subscriber. If you need to publish data, then you need a “bigger” SQL Edition.\n\n### 4. Do you need Database Mail?\n\nSQL Express does not have Database Mail. You have to find other ways to code your notifications. This question has raised counter-questions from customers as to “What would I need Database Mail for?”. It is, evidently a feature not used by many. Personally, I find it useful. [Clay McDonald has a nice blog-post](http://claysql.blogspot.com/2009/02/send-database-mail-from-trigger.html) on how to make SQL-triggers send mail on, for instance, inserts into a table using Database Mail. You could of course have it send mail on deletions as well. In my mind, this might come in handy in user-databases in CRM- or HR-systems. Every time an employee gets deleted from the database, the HR-admin could receive a notification.\n\n### 5. Do you need the SQL Agent?\n\nPerhaps not. Maybe you feel comfortable with scheduling your database backups using the windows scheduler and homebrew scripts. Just make sure your monitoring software (or IT-personnel) discover when the script fails. An increasing amount of applications require the SQL Agent to schedule and monitor recurring tasks, like Microsoft's App-V. Without the SQL Agent, the databases would grow ad infinitum. How about index maintenance? This is also possible to go by using your own scripts and the windows scheduler. SQL Express can do most maintenance tasks you would need using scripts and T-SQL. The SQL Agent just makes it simpler and more manageable. Once again, double-check this with the application developer.\n\n### 6. Do you application use SSIS/DTS-jobs?\n\nThis is not included in SQL Express. Maybe there’s a work-around, but I haven’t found it and I doubt it is supported by anyone.\n\n### 7. Do you need to be able to troubleshoot performance problems?\n\nYou can do this on SQL Express with a great deal of knowledge and timers. The SQL-profiler, the Performance Data Collection and the Database Tuning Advisor makes it easier. Specifically, the SQL-profiler comes in really handy when you suspect the application (not the system) to be the bad guy since you can trace the queries and pin-point where the performance-hit resides. Using the SQL-profiler I have been able to optimise indexes to and thus making database servers go from a 98% CPU Load to 3% CPU Load. I have also been able to pin-point specific queries and use them as “evidence” that the problem is bad/sloppy code rather than problems with the database server. Also, using the SQL-profiler.\n\nThere’s more, of course, but these point are the most common pit-falls in my experience. As you can see, there’s three “do you need”-questions  and there are highly optional. Far from everyone use them and often because of lacking SQL Server knowledge. You don’t know what you can do. Still, the most important question is #1\\. Is SQL Express a supported database server for your applications. Hopefully, the developer knows the answer to this directly. No maybe’s. Yes or No.\n\nPersonally, I find that If you need a database server for production data, don’t go for SQL Express. Many customers have gone that way because “it’s free!” just to find themselves in the midst of a SQL Server upgrade and database migration a year later.","slug":"whynotusesqlexpress-itsforfree","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-05T12:55:35.824Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj84pjjnd00dweogirl9yyczq","content":"<h1 id=\"Background\"><a href=\"#Background\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Background\"></a>Background</h1><p>I get this question every now and then and every time I find myself completely flabbergasted and having to look things up once again.
